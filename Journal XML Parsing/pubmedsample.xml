Modification of the hexahydronaphthalene moiety of simvastatin: 5-oxygenated and 5-oxa derivatives.2489-95Modification of the hexahydronaphthalene ring 5-position in simvastatin 2a via oxygenation and oxa replacement afforded two series of derivatives which were evaluated in vitro for inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase and acutely in vivo for oral effectiveness as inhibitors of cholesterogenesis in the rat. Of the compounds selected for further biological evaluation, the 6 beta-methyl-5-oxa 10 and 5 alpha-hydroxy 16 derivatives of 3,4,4a,5-tetrahydro 2a, as well as, the 6 beta-epimer 14 of 16 proved orally active as hypocholesterolemic agents in cholestyramine-primed dogs. Subsequent acute oral metabolism studies in dogs demonstrated that compounds 14 and 16 evoke lower peak plasma drug activity and area-under-the-curve values than does compound 10 and led to the selection of 14 and 16 for toxicological evaluation.DugganM EMEMerck Sharp &amp; Dohme Research Laboratories, West Point, Pennsylvania 19486.AlbertsA WAWBostedorRRChaoY SYSGermershausenJ IJIGilfillanJ LJLHalczenkoWWHartmanG DGDHuntVVImagireJ SJSengJournal ArticleUnited StatesJ Med Chem97165310022-262306-(2-(8-(2,2-dimethylbutyryl)oxy)-2,6-dimethyl-5-hydroxy-1,2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-decahydronaphthyl-1-ethyl)-4-hydroxy-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one0Acetates0Anticholesteremic Agents0Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors97C5T2UQ7JCholesterol9LHU78OQFDLovastatinAGG2FN16EVSimvastatinS88TT14065OxygenIMAcetatesmetabolismAnimalsAnticholesteremic Agentschemical synthesispharmacokineticspharmacologyChemical PhenomenaChemistryCholesterolbiosynthesisDogsHydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase InhibitorsKineticsLovastatinanalogs &amp; derivativeschemical synthesischemistrypharmacokineticspharmacologyMaleMolecular ConformationMolecular StructureOxygenRatsSimvastatinStructure-Activity Relationship</MedlineCitation>

Biochem.Purification and characterisation of a water-soluble ferrochelatase from Bacillus subtilis.201-8Bacillus subtilis ferrochelatase is encoded by the hemH gene of the hemEHY gene cluster and catalyses the incorporation of Fe2+ into protoporphyrin IX. B. subtilis ferrochelatase produced in Escherichia coli was purified. It was found to be a monomeric, water-soluble enzyme of molecular mass 35 kDa which in addition to Fe2+ can incorporate Zn2+ and Cu2+ into protoporphyrin IX. Chemical modification experiments indicated that the single cysteine residue in the ferrochelatase is required for enzyme activity although it is not a conserved residue compared to other ferrochelatases. In growing B. subtilis, the ferrochelatase constitutes approximately 0.05% (by mass) of the total cell protein, which corresponds to some 600 ferrochelatase molecules/cell. The turnover number of isolated ferrochelatase, 18-29 min-1, was found to be consistent with the rate of haem synthesis in exponentially growing cells (0.2 mol haem formed/min/mol enzyme). It is concluded that the B. subtilis ferrochelatase has enzymic properties which are similar to those of other characterised ferrochelatases of known primary structure, i.e. ferrochelatases of the mitochondrial inner membrane of yeast and mammalian cells. However, in contrast to these enzymes the B. subtilis enzyme is a water-soluble protein and should be more amenable to structural analysis.HanssonMMDepartment of Microbiology, Lund University, Sweden.HederstedtLLengJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tEnglandEur J Biochem01076000014-2956059QF0KO0RWaterEC 4.99.1.1FerrochelataseIMhemEhemHhemYAmino Acid SequenceBacillus subtilisenzymologygeneticsCatalysisCloning, MolecularEscherichia colienzymologygeneticsFerrochelatasegeneticsisolation &amp; purificationmetabolismGene DeletionGenes, BacterialKineticsMolecular Sequence DataMolecular WeightSolubilityWater</MedlineCitation>

The radiographic reports of all patients were reviewed to identify cases in which the filter failed to open symmetrically after deployment and catheter or wire manipulation of the filter was performed. The reports and angiograms from these patients were reviewed with respect to the circumstances surrounding filter placement and methods to achieve more symmetric opening.Transcatheter manipulation of asymmetrically opened filters was performed in 15 of 166 cases (9%). In 12 of these patients, acceptable and uneventful opening of the filter was achieved with a guide wire, pigtail catheter, or occlusion balloon catheter. In one case manipulation only partly improved orientation of the limbs, while in another case successful manipulation was complicated by distal migration. In the final case, the asymmetric filter covered only part of the lumen of the vena cava despite manipulations and a second filter was placed for optimal caval interruption. No specific cause for incomplete expansion was identified in any case.Marked asymmetry in opening of the modified hook titanium Greenfield filter that warrants manipulation occurs infrequently, but recognition and proper management may be important to ensure optimal caval interruption.MooreB SBSDepartment of Radiology, University of California at San Diego 92103.ValjiKKRobertsA CACBooksteinJ JJJengJournal ArticleUnited StatesJ Vasc Interv Radiol92033691051-0443D1JT611TNETitaniumIMJ Vasc Interv Radiol. 1994 May-Jun;5(3):526-78054760J Vasc Interv Radiol. 1993 Sep-Oct;4(5):617-208219555J Vasc Interv Radiol. 1994 May-Jun;5(3):528-328054761Catheterization, Central VenousHumansRadiographyTitaniumVena Cava FiltersVena Cava, Inferiordiagnostic imaging</MedlineCitation>

Pharmacol.Mechanism of extracellular ATP-induced proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells.1000-9The mitogenic effect of extracellular ATP was examined in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). ATP, 2-methylthio-ATP, and ADP stimulated [3H]thymidine and [3H]leucine incorporation and cell growth. AMP, adenosine, UTP, and P2x agonists showed little of these effects. Reactive blue 2, a P2Y purinoceptor antagonist, was effective in suppressing the mitogenic effect of ATP and 2-methylthio-ATP, indicating that extracellular ATP-induced VSMC proliferation is mediated by P2Y purinoceptors. The P2Y purinoceptor activation was coupled to a pertussis toxin (PTX)-insensitive G protein (Gq) and triggered phosphoinositide hydrolysis with subsequent activation of protein kinase C (PKC), Raf-1, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in VSMCs. In response to ATP, both 42-and 44-kDa MAPKs were activated, and tyrosine was phosphorylated. Western blot analysis using PKC isozyme-specific antibodies indicated that VSMCs express PKC-alpha, PKC-delta, and PKC-zeta. A complete down-regulation of PKC-alpha and PKC-delta was seen after 24-hr treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. When cells were pretreated with 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate for 24 hr and subsequently challenged with ATP, Raf-1 activation and 42-kDa as well as 44-kDa MAPK tyrosine phosphorylation failed to be induced. These results demonstrate that ATP-induced Raf-1 and MAPK activations involve the activation of PKC-alpha and PKC-delta. P2Y purinoceptor stimulation with ATP also caused accumulation of c-fos and c-myc mRNAs. Both Reactive blue 2 and staurosporine significantly blocked this increase by ATP. In conclusion, the mitogenic effect of ATP seemed to be triggered by activation of the Gq protein-coupled P2Y purinoceptor that led to the formation of inositol trisphosphate and activation of PKC. PKC and, in turn, Raf-1 and MAPK were then activated, leading eventually to DNA synthesis and cell proliferation.YuS MSMDepartment of Pharmacology, Chang Gung College of Medicine and Technology, Kwei-San, Tao-Yuan, Taiwan. smyu@cguaplo.cgu.eduChenS FSFLauY TYTYangC MCMChenJ CJCengJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tRetracted PublicationUnited StatesMol Pharmacol00356230026-895X0Proto-Oncogene Proteins0RNA, Messenger0Receptors, Purinergic P20Transcription Factors10028-17-8Tritium8L70Q75FXEAdenosine Triphosphate9007-49-2DNAEC 2.7.11.1Protein-Serine-Threonine KinasesEC 2.7.11.1Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rafEC 2.7.11.13Protein Kinase CEC 2.7.11.17Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein KinasesEC 3.6.1.-GTP-Binding ProteinsGMW67QNF9CLeucineVC2W18DGKRThymidineIMMol Pharmacol 1997 Mar;51(3):533Wu D, Yang CM, Lau YT, Chen JC.

A systematic overview and meta-analysis.[34457 words; 185 paragraphs]This overview reports the efficacy of conservative treatments (drug therapy, manual therapy, patient education, physical medicine modalities) in reducing pain in adults with mechanical neck disorders.Computerized bibliographic database searches from 1985 to December 1993, information requests from authors, and bibliography screenings were used to identify published and unpublished research. Applying strict criteria, two investigators independently reviewed the blinded articles. Each selected trial was evaluated independently for methodologic quality.Twenty-four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and eight before-after studies met our selection criteria. Twenty RCTs rated moderately strong or better in terms of methodologic quality. Five trials using manual therapy in combination with other treatments were clinically similar, were statistically not heterogeneous (p = 0.98), and were combined to yield an effect size of -0.6 (95% CI: -0.9, -0.4), equivalent to a 16 point improvement on a 100 point pain scale. Four RCTs using physical medicine modalities were combined using the inverse chi-square method: two using electromagnetic therapy produced a significant reduction in pain (p &lt; 0.01); and two using laser therapy did not differ significantly from a placebo (p = 0.63). Little or no scientific evidence exists for other therapies, including such commonly used treatments as medication, rest and exercise.Within the limits of methodologic quality, the best available evidence supports the use of manual therapies in combination with other treatments for short-term relief of neck pain. There is some support for the use of electromagnetic therapy and against the use of laser therapy. In general, other interventions have not been studied in enough detail adequately to assess efficacy or effectiveness. This overview provides the foundation for an evidence-based approach to practice. More robust design and methodology should be used in future research, in particular, the use of valid and reliable outcomes measures.GrossA RARChedoke-McMaster Hospitals &amp; Schools of Rehabilitation Science, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.AkerP DPDGoldsmithC HCHPelosoPPengJournal ArticleMeta-AnalysisResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tUnited StatesOnline J Curr Clin Trials9300367A1059-2725IMAcupuncture TherapyAdultChiropracticDatabases, BibliographicHumansManipulation, OrthopedicNeck InjuriesPaindrug therapyrehabilitationPain ManagementPatient Education as TopicPhysical Therapy ModalitiesRandomized Controlled Trials as TopicReproducibility of ResultsWounds and Injuriesdrug therapyrehabilitationtherapy</MedlineCitation>

Rest-4-hour-24-hour 201Tl tomography versus dobutamine echocardiography.2712-9To date, late redistribution after resting 201Tl injection has not been evaluated. In addition, the concordance between resting 201Tl imaging and dobutamine echocardiography in identifying viable myocardium has not been assessed.Forty patients with coronary artery disease underwent rest-4-hour-24-hour 201Tl tomography and dobutamine echocardiography (5 to 10 micrograms.kg-1.min-1). Late redistribution occurred in 46 (21%) of 219 persistent defects at 4 hours. Systolic function and contractile reserve were similar among persistent defects at 4 hours with and without late redistribution. Contractile reserve was more frequent in segments with normal 201Tl uptake (59%), completely reversible defects (53%), or mild to moderate defects at 4 hours (56%) compared with severe defects (14%; P &lt; .02 versus all). Of 105 hypokinetic segments, 99 (94%) were viable by 201Tl, and 88 (84%) showed contractile reserve. In contrast, of 155 akinetic segments, 119 (77%) were viable by 201Tl, but only 34 (22%) had contractile reserve. Concordance between 201Tl and dobutamine was 82% in hypokinetic segments but 43% in akinetic segments. In 109 revascularized segments, positive accuracy for functional recovery was 72% for 201Tl and 92% for dobutamine, whereas negative accuracy was 100% and 65%, respectively. Sensitivity was 100% for 201Tl and 79% for dobutamine.Late redistribution occurs in one fifth of persistent defects at 4 hours, and it does not correlate to systolic function or contractile reserve. Dobutamine and 201Tl yield concordant information in the majority of hypokinetic segments, whereas concordance is low in akinetic segments. Dobutamine demonstrates higher positive accuracy and sensitivity in predicting recovery of dysfunctional myocardium, whereas 201Tl shows higher negative predictive accuracy but reduced positive accuracy.Perrone-FilardiPPDivision of Cardiology, Federico II University Medical School, Naples, Italy.PaceLLPrastaroMMSquameFFBetocchiSSSoricelliAAPiscioneFFIndolfiCCCrisciTTSalvatoreMMChiarielloMMengJournal ArticleUnited StatesCirculation01477630009-73220Thallium Radioisotopes3S12J47372DobutamineAIMIMCirculation. 1996 Dec 1;94(11):2685-88941087Circulation. 1996 Dec 1;94(11):2674-808941085Circulation. 1996 Dec 1;94(11):2681-48941086Circulation. 1997 Oct 21;96(8):2740-29355926AgedCell SurvivalChronic DiseaseCircadian RhythmCoronary Diseasediagnostic imagingphysiopathologyDobutamineEchocardiographyFollow-Up StudiesHeartdiagnostic imagingHumansMaleMiddle AgedMyocardial ContractionMyocardial RevascularizationRadionuclide ImagingRestSystoleThallium RadioisotopespharmacokineticsTime FactorsVentricular Dysfunction, Leftdiagnostic imagingtherapy</MedlineCitation>

Immunol.Hypermutation, diversity and dissemination of human intestinal lamina propria plasma cells.2959-64In this work we have microdissected lamina propria plasma cells and used polymerase chain reaction and sequencing to investigate immunoglobulin (Ig) gene rearrangements and mutations in human intestine. In addition, specific primers were designed for individual Ig gene rearrangements to analyze the distribution of related B cell and plasma cell clones at different sites along the bowel. Confirming our earlier work, intestinal IgVH genes were highly mutated in plasma cells from older individuals (&gt; 30 years). IgVH genes were significantly less mutated in samples taken from patients aged 11-30 years, and there were fewer mutations again in samples from young children (&lt; 11 years). In age-matched specimens the number of mutations was equivalent in the duodenum and colon. Using complementarity-determining region 3 primers to amplify specific Ig gene rearrangements, evidence was also found for the existence of related lamina propria plasma cells along the small bowel and colon, although these were quite scarce. In addition, analysis of the numbers of related clones in a random sampling from discrete areas of lamina propria indicates that the local population is diverse. These results suggest that the highly mutated IgVH genes in adult intestinal plasma cells are a consequence of chronic antigen exposure with age. Duodenal plasma cells are as highly mutated as colonic plasma cells, despite the fact that the upper bowel has no indigenous microbial flora (the stimulus for intestinal plasma cells). They also show that the plasma cell population is diverse and can be widely disseminated along the bowel.Dunn-WaltersD KDKDepartment of Histopathology, UMDS, London, Great Britain.BoursierLLSpencerJJengGENBANKZ93128Z93129Z93130Z93131Z93132Z93133Z93134Z93135Z93136Z93137Z93138Z93139Z93140Z93141Z93142Z93143Z93144Z93145Z93146Z93147Z93148Z93149Z93150Z93151Z93152Z93153Z93154Z93155Z93156Z93157Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tGermanyEur J Immunol12732010014-29800Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains0Immunoglobulin Variable RegionIMAdolescentAdultAgedAged, 80 and overAginggeneticsimmunologyBase SequenceChildColonimmunologymetabolismDuodenumimmunologymetabolismGene RearrangementimmunologyGenes, ImmunoglobulinHumansImmunoglobulin Heavy ChainsgeneticsImmunoglobulin Variable RegiongeneticsInfantIntestinal MucosacytologyimmunologyMiddle AgedMolecular Sequence DataMutationOrgan SpecificitygeneticsimmunologyPlasma Cellsimmunologymetabolism</MedlineCitation>

In a randomized, prospective study, patients undergoing routine elective coronary artery bypass grafting were managed with either early or late tracheal extubation. The incidence and severity of electrocardiographic myocardial ischaemia were compared. Data were analysed from 85 patients (43 early extubation; 42 late extubation). Median time to extubation was 110 min in the early extubation patients and 757 min in the late extubation patients. After correction for randomization bias, there were no significant differences between groups in ischaemic burden, maximal ST-segment deviation, incidence of ischaemia and area under the ST deviation-time curve (integral of ST deviation and time). Similarly, there were no differences between groups in postoperative creatine kinase MB-isoenzyme concentrations and duration of stay in the ICU or hospital. Therefore, this study provides evidence for the safety of early extubation after routine coronary artery bypass grafting.BerryP DPDCardiothoracic Centre Liverpool-NHS Trust.ThomasS DSDMahonS PSPJacksonMMFoxM AMAFabriBBWeirW IWIRussellG NGNengClinical TrialJournal ArticleRandomized Controlled TrialEnglandBr J Anaesth03725410007-0912IMBr J Anaesth 1998 Apr;80(4):572Br J Anaesth 1998 Jul;81(1):111AdultAgedCoronary Artery Bypassadverse effectsElectrocardiographyFemaleHumansIntubation, IntratrachealmethodsMaleMiddle AgedMyocardial IschemiaetiologyPostoperative CaremethodsPostoperative PeriodProspective StudiesTreatment Outcome</MedlineCitation>

Entrapment of the cauda equina roots by hypertrophy of the osseous and soft tissue structures surrounding the lumbar spinal canal is often associated with incapacitating pain in the back and lower extremities, difficulty ambulating, leg paresthesias and weakness and, in severe cases, bowel or bladder disturbances. The characteristic syndrome associated with lumbar stenosis is termed neurogenic intermittent claudication. This condition must be differentiated from true claudication, which is caused by atherosclerosis of the pelvofemoral vessels. Although many conditions may be associated with lumbar canal stenosis, most cases are idiopathic. Imaging of the lumbar spine performed with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging often demonstrates narrowing of the lumbar canal with compression of the cauda equina nerve roots by thickened posterior vertebral elements, facet joints, marginal osteophytes or soft tissue structures such as the ligamentum flavum or herniated discs. Treatment for symptomatic lumbar stenosis is usually surgical decompression. Medical treatment alternatives, such as bed rest, pain management and physical therapy, should be reserved for use in debilitated patients or patients whose surgical risk is prohibitive as a result of concomitant medical conditions.AlvarezJ AJAUniversity Hospitals of Cleveland/Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.HardyR HRHJrengJournal ArticleReviewUnited StatesAm Fam Physician12726460002-838XAIMIMAm Fam Physician. 1999 Jan 15;59(2):280, 283-49930124Diagnosis, DifferentialHumansLow Back PainetiologyLumbosacral RegionPainetiologyPatient Education as TopicSpinal StenosiscomplicationsdiagnosisphysiopathologytherapyTeaching Materials13</MedlineCitation>

The purpose of this review was to evaluate recent prospective studies concerning the short- and long-term prognosis of patients suffering from systemic inflammatory-response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock. It has been shown in multicentre prospective surveys that 1% and 0.3% of all patients admitted to hospitals suffer, respectively, from bacteraemia alone and bacteraemia with severe sepsis. This rate increases, of course, when only admissions to the ICUs are considered: the above-mentioned rates increase then by a factor of 8 and 30, respectively. Thus, approximately 10% of patients in the ICU suffer from sepsis, 6% from severe sepsis and 2-3% from septic shock. SIRS occurs more frequently and its occurrence ranges from 40% to 70% of all patients admitted to ICUs. Thereby, 40-70% suffering from SIRS progress to a more severe septic-disease state. The overall prognosis is still poor, despite the recent advances in ICU treatment. The mortality rate of SIRS ranges from 6% to 7% and in septic shock amounts to over 50%. In particular, abdominal sepsis exhibits the highest mortality rate with 72%. The long-term prognosis is equally poor; only approximately 30% survived the first year after hospital admission.The prognosis of sepsis and septic shock remains poor, despite the advances in ICU treatment. Although prognostic factors have been identified for some patients, groups have not yet been able to identify the immediate or long-term prognosis for the majority of these septic patients.SchoenbergM HMHDepartment of General Surgery, University of Ulm, Germany.WeissMMRadermacherPPengJournal ArticleReviewGermanyLangenbecks Arch Surg98082851435-2443IMAdultBacteremiamortalitytherapyCause of DeathCritical CareFemaleHumansMalePrognosisProspective StudiesShock, SepticmortalitytherapySurgical Wound InfectionmortalitytherapySurvival RateSystemic Inflammatory Response Syndromemortalitytherapy21</MedlineCitation>

J.Hepatitis C virus infection and heart diseases: a multicenter study in Japan.389-91As a collaborative research project of the Committees for the Study of Idiopathic Cardiomyopathy, a questionnaire was sent out to 19 medical institutions in Japan in order to examine the possible association between hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and cardiomyopathies. Hepatitis C virus antibody was found in 74 of 697 patients (10.6%) with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (mean age, 57.7 years) and in 42 of 663 patients (6.3%) with dilated cardiomyopathy (mean age, 56.5 years); these prevalences were significantly higher than that found in volunteer blood donors in Japan (2.4%, 50-59 years of age, each p&lt;0.0001). The prevalence was significantly higher in patients suffering from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as opposed to those with dilated cardiomyopathy (p&lt;0.01). The presence of HCV antibody was detected in 650 of 11,967 patients (5.4%) patients seeking care in 5 academic hospitals. Various cardiac abnormalities were found among these patients, arrhythmias being the most frequent. These observations suggest that HCV infection is an important cause of a variety of otherwise unexplained heart diseases.MatsumoriAAKyoto University, Japan.OhashiNNHasegawaKKSasayamaSSEtoTTImaizumiTTIzumiTTKawamuraKKKawanaMMKimuraAAKitabatakeAAMatsuzakiMMNagaiRRTanakaHHHiroeMMHoriMMInokoHHSekoYYSekiguchiMMShimotohnoKKSugishitaYYTakedaNNTakiharaKKTanakaMMYokoyamaMMengJournal ArticleMulticenter StudyResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tJapanJpn Circ J78068680047-18280Hepatitis C AntibodiesIMCardiomyopathiesepidemiologyetiologyvirologyHeartvirologyHeart DiseasesepidemiologyetiologyvirologyHepacivirusimmunologyHepatitis CcomplicationsHepatitis C AntibodiesbloodHumansJapanepidemiologyMiddle AgedMyocardiumimmunologypathologyPrevalenceSurveys and Questionnaires</MedlineCitation>

Systematic studies on the effects of SSRIs on cardiac function are scarce, despite the high prevalence of cardiac disorders in the older depressed patient. This is a study which systematically assessed cardiac function by echocardiography in middle-aged and elderly depressed patients treated with SSRI. In a double-blind randomized trial, 20 patients were assigned to receive fluvoxamine 100 mg/day [DOSAGE ERROR CORRECTED] or fluoxetine 20 mg/day [DOSAGE ERROR CORRECTED] for 6 weeks. Cardiac function was assessed by left ventricle ejection fraction, aortic flow integral and early or passive/late or active mitral inflow, and electrocardiography. Neither SSRI significantly affected cardiac function. Compared with patients without a history of myocardial infarction and/or hypertension, patients with such a history showed a significant improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction. Despite our small study sample, these data indicate that both fluoxetine and fluvoxamine do not affect cardiac function adversely.StrikJ JJJDepartment of Psychiatry, Maastricht University Hospital, The Netherlands.HonigAALousbergRRCheriexE CECVan PraagH MHMengClinical TrialComparative StudyJournal ArticleRandomized Controlled TrialEnglandInt Clin Psychopharmacol86090610268-13150Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors01K63SUP8DFluoxetineO4L1XPO44WFluvoxamineIMInt Clin Psychopharmacol 1999 Mar;14(2):138Dosage error in published abstract; MEDLINE/PubMed abstract correctedAgedAged, 80 and overCardiovascular Diseaseschemically inducedphysiopathologyDepressive Disordercomplicationsdrug therapyDouble-Blind MethodEchocardiographyElectrocardiographydrug effectsFemaleFluoxetineadverse effectstherapeutic useFluvoxamineadverse effectstherapeutic useHumansMaleMiddle AgedSerotonin Uptake Inhibitorsadverse effectstherapeutic use</MedlineCitation>

However, clinical trials of CCK agonists in schizophrenia patients showed mixed results. To re-examine the antipsychotic potential of CCK-based treatments, we examined systemic injections of CCK analogs in an animal model with strong face and construct validity for sensorimotor-gating deficits seen in schizophrenia patients and with strong predictive validity for antipsychotic drug activity. Prepulse inhibition (PPI) occurs when a weak acoustic lead stimulus ("prepulse") inhibits the startle response to a sudden loud sound ("pulse"). PPI is significantly reduced in schizophrenia patients and rats treated with dopamine agonists. Antipsychotics reverse decreased PPI in rats to a degree highly correlated with their clinical efficacy. Subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of caerulein (10 micrograms/kg) a mixed CCKA/B agonist, partially reversed amphetamine-induced reduction of PPI; whereas, s.c. haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg) totally reversed amphetamine-induced disruption of PPI. Caerulein's effect on PPI was blocked by pretreatment with a CCKA antagonist (devazepide) but not a CCKB antagonist (L-365,260). CCK-4, a preferential CCKB agonist, had no significant effect on PPI. These results suggest that caerulein produces a weak neuroleptic-like effect on PPI that is mediated by stimulation of CCKA receptors. Possible circuities in this effect are discussed. In a separate experiment, s.c. caerulein produced to a more potent neuroleptic-like profile on amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion, suggesting that selection of preclinical paradigms may be important in evaluating the antipsychotic potential of CCK-based treatments.FeifelDDDepartment of Psychiatry, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093-8620, USA.RezaTTRobeckSSengJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tEnglandNeuropsychopharmacology89049070893-133X0Antipsychotic Agents0Gastrointestinal Agents0Receptors, Cholecystokinin0OL293AV80Tetragastrin888Y08971BCeruletide9011-97-6CholecystokininJ6292F8L3DHaloperidolIMAnimalsAntipsychotic Agentsadministration &amp; dosagetherapeutic useBehavior, Animaldrug effectsCeruletidetherapeutic useCholecystokininphysiologyGastrointestinal Agentstherapeutic useHaloperidoladministration &amp; dosagetherapeutic useInjections, SubcutaneousMaleMotor Activitydrug effectsPsychotic Disordersdrug therapypsychologyRatsRats, Sprague-DawleyReceptors, Cholecystokininantagonists &amp; inhibitorsdrug effectsReflex, Startledrug effectsTetragastrinantagonists &amp; inhibitorspharmacology</MedlineCitation>

By 1995, there were formal HTA programs in 24 countries established mostly in the late 1980s and early 1990s. European countries generally have one or two federal or provincial HTA programs each, Canada has an extensive network of federal and regional organizations coordinated by a central body and the US has 53 HTA organizations, the vast majority of which are in the private sector. While the commitment of the US government to HTA has been erratic, the private sector has been witness to an expansion of HTA activities by insurance companies, hospitals, medical/device manufacturers, consulting firms and health professional societies. In contrast to other developed countries, the current state of technology assessment in the US is decentralized, fragmented and duplicative. We conclude by discussing the importance of a US HTA agency at the national level.PerrySSMedical Technology and Practice Patterns Institute, WHO Collaborating Center on Health Technology Assessment, Washington, DC 20007, USA.ThamerMMengComparative StudyJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tIrelandHealth Policy84094310168-8510HHealth Policy 1997 Dec;42(3):269-90CanadaDiffusion of InnovationEuropeHealth Care SurveysHealth PolicyInformation ServicesPrivate SectorTechnology Assessment, Biomedicallegislation &amp; jurisprudencemethodsorganization &amp; administrationstatistics &amp; numerical dataUnited StatesUnited States Office of Technology Assessment</MedlineCitation>

U.S.A.Thermal adaptation analyzed by comparison of protein sequences from mesophilic and extremely thermophilic Methanococcus species.3578-83The genome sequence of the extremely thermophilic archaeon Methanococcus jannaschii provides a wealth of data on proteins from a thermophile. In this paper, sequences of 115 proteins from M. jannaschii are compared with their homologs from mesophilic Methanococcus species. Although the growth temperatures of the mesophiles are about 50 degrees C below that of M. jannaschii, their genomic G+C contents are nearly identical. The properties most correlated with the proteins of the thermophile include higher residue volume, higher residue hydrophobicity, more charged amino acids (especially Glu, Arg, and Lys), and fewer uncharged polar residues (Ser, Thr, Asn, and Gln). These are recurring themes, with all trends applying to 83-92% of the proteins for which complete sequences were available. Nearly all of the amino acid replacements most significantly correlated with the temperature change are the same relatively conservative changes observed in all proteins, but in the case of the mesophile/thermophile comparison there is a directional bias. We identify 26 specific pairs of amino acids with a statistically significant (P &lt; 0.01) preferred direction of replacement.HaneyP JPJDepartment of Microbiology, University of Illinois, B103 Chemical and Life Sciences Laboratory, 601 South Goodwin Avenue, Urbana, IL 61801, USA.BadgerJ HJHBuldakG LGLReichC ICIWoeseC RCROlsenG JGJengGENBANKAF078607AF078608AF078609AF078610AF078611AF078612AF078613AF078614AF078615AF078616AF078617AF078618AF078619AF078620AF078621AF078622AF078623AF078624AF078625AF078626AF078627AF078628AF078629AF078630AF078631AF078632AF078633AF078634AF078635AF078636T32 GM007283GMNIGMS NIH HHSUnited StatesGM07283GMNIGMS NIH HHSUnited StatesComparative StudyJournal ArticleResearch Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.United StatesProc Natl Acad Sci U S A75058760027-84240Bacterial ProteinsIMSJ Theor Biol. 1967 Aug;16(2):187-2116048539Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1998 Mar 3;95(5):2056-609482837J Theor Biol. 1973 Jun;39(3):645-514354159Science. 1974 Sep 6;185(4154):862-44843792J Theor Biol. 1975 Mar;50(1):167-831127956Nature. 1975 May 15;255(5505):256-91143325Biochemistry. 1979 Dec 11;18(25):5698-703518863Eur J Biochem. 1980 Jul;108(2):581-67408869J Biochem. 1980 Dec;88(6):1895-87462208J Mol Biol. 1982 May 5;157(1):105-327108955Eur J Biochem. 1982 Nov 15;128(2-3):565-757151796Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1986 Nov;83(21):8069-723464944J Biol Chem. 1988 Mar 5;263(7):3086-913257756J Mol Biol. 1988 Feb 5;199(3):525-373127592Nature. 1988 Dec 15;336(6200):651-63200317Adv Protein Chem. 1988;39:191-2343072868J Mol Biol. 1989 Mar 20;206(2):397-4062716053Proteins. 1989;5(1):22-372664764Biochemistry. 1989 Sep 5;28(18):7205-132684274Science. 1990 Mar 16;247(4948):1306-102315699Biochemistry. 1990 Mar 6;29(9):2403-82337607Biochemistry. 1990 Aug 7;29(31):7133-552207096J Mol Biol. 1990 Oct 5;215(3):403-102231712Biochemistry. 1991 Jan 15;30(2):589-941988046Biochemistry. 1991 Jul 23;30(29):7142-531854726Crit Rev Biochem Mol Biol. 1991;26(1):1-521678690Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1992 May 1;89(9):3751-51570293Nat Genet. 1993 Mar;3(3):266-728485583J Mol Biol. 1994 Dec 2;244(3):332-507966343J Mol Biol. 1995 Mar 3;246(4):511-217877172Eur J Biochem. 1995 May 1;229(3):688-957758464Appl Environ Microbiol. 1995 Jul;61(7):2762-47618889J Bacteriol. 1996 Feb;178(3):723-78550506Structure. 1995 Nov 15;3(11):1147-588591026Nucleic Acids Res. 1996 Jan 1;24(1):1-58594554Biochemistry. 1996 Feb 27;35(8):2597-6098611563Protein Eng. 1995 Aug;8(8):779-898637847Protein Eng. 1996 Jan;9(1):27-369053899Science. 1996 Aug 23;273(5278):1058-738688087Proteins. 1997 May;28(1):117-309144797J Mol Biol. 1997 Jun 20;269(4):631-439217266Gene. 1997 Dec 31;205(1-2):309-169461405J Theor Biol. 1968 Nov;21(2):170-2015700434AcclimatizationAmino Acid SequenceAmino Acid SubstitutionBacterial ProteinschemistrygeneticsMethanococcusgeneticsmetabolismMolecular Sequence DataProtein ConformationSpecies SpecificityTemperaturePMC22336NASA Discipline ExobiologyNon-NASA CenterWoeseC RCRU IL, Urbana</MedlineCitation>

This study investigated the interrelationships between side-lying positions and indexes of lung function such as spirometry, alveolar diffusing capacity, and inhomogeneity of ventilation in older individuals.Nineteen nonsmoking subjects (mean age=62.8 years, SD=6.8, range=50-74) with no history of cardiac or pulmonary disease were tested over 2 sessions. The test positions were sitting and left side lying in one session and sitting and right side lying in the other session. In each of the positions, forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), single-breath pulmonary diffusing capacity (DLCO/VA), and the slope of phase III (DN2%/L) of the single-breath nitrogen washout test to determine inhomogeneity of ventilation were measured.Compared with measurements obtained in the sitting position, FVC and FEV1 were decreased equally in the side-lying positions, but no change was observed in DLCO/VA or DN2%/L.Side-lying positions resulted in decreases in FVC and FEV1, which is consistent with the well-documented effects of the supine position. These findings further support the need for prescriptive rather than routine body positioning of patients with risks of cardiopulmonary compromise and the need to use upright positions in which lung volumes and capacities are maximized.ManningFFFamily Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.DeanEERossJJAbboudR TRTengJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tUnited StatesPhys Ther00226230031-9023AIMIMSAgedphysiologyBreath TestsFemaleForced Expiratory VolumephysiologyHeart Diseasesprevention &amp; controlHumansLung Diseasesprevention &amp; controlMaleMiddle AgedPosturephysiologyPredictive Value of TestsPulmonary Diffusing CapacityphysiologySpirometryVital Capacityphysiology</MedlineCitation>

Microbiol.Transcription regulation of the nir gene cluster encoding nitrite reductase of Paracoccus denitrificans involves NNR and NirI, a novel type of membrane protein.24-36The nirIX gene cluster of Paracoccus denitrificans is located between the nir and nor gene clusters encoding nitrite and nitric oxide reductases respectively. The NirI sequence corresponds to that of a membrane-bound protein with six transmembrane helices, a large periplasmic domain and cysteine-rich cytoplasmic domains that resemble the binding sites of [4Fe-4S] clusters in many ferredoxin-like proteins. NirX is soluble and apparently located in the periplasm, as judged by the predicted signal sequence. NirI and NirX are homologues of NosR and NosX, proteins involved in regulation of the expression of the nos gene cluster encoding nitrous oxide reductase in Pseudomonas stutzeri and Sinorhizobium meliloti. Analysis of a NirI-deficient mutant strain revealed that NirI is involved in transcription activation of the nir gene cluster in response to oxygen limitation and the presence of N-oxides. The NirX-deficient mutant transiently accumulated nitrite in the growth medium, but it had a final growth yield similar to that of the wild type. Transcription of the nirIX gene cluster itself was controlled by NNR, a member of the family of FNR-like transcriptional activators. An NNR binding sequence is located in the middle of the intergenic region between the nirI and nirS genes with its centre located at position -41.5 relative to the transcription start sites of both genes. Attempts to complement the NirI mutation via cloning of the nirIX gene cluster on a broad-host-range vector were unsuccessful, the ability to express nitrite reductase being restored only when the nirIX gene cluster was reintegrated into the chromosome of the NirI-deficient mutant via homologous recombination in such a way that the wild-type nirI gene was present directly upstream of the nir operon.SaundersN FNFDepartment of Molecular Cell Physiology, Faculty of Biology, BioCentrum Amsterdam, Vrije Universiteit, De Boelelaan 1087, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands.HoubenE NENKoefoedSSde WeertSSReijndersW NWNWesterhoffH VHVDe BoerA PAPVan SpanningR JRJengGENBANKAF005358U47133U94899PDBP33943Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tEnglandMol Microbiol87120280950-382X0Bacterial Proteins0DNA-Binding Proteins0Membrane Proteins0NNR protein, Paracoccus denitrificans0NirI protein, Paracoccus denitrificans0NirX protein, Paracoccus denitrificans0Transcription FactorsEC 1.7.-Nitrite ReductasesIMAmino Acid SequenceBacterial ProteinsBase SequenceDNA-Binding ProteinsGene Expression Regulation, BacterialGenetic Complementation TestMembrane ProteinschemistrygeneticsmetabolismMolecular Sequence DataMultigene FamilyMutationNitrite ReductasesgeneticsmetabolismParacoccus denitrificansgeneticsmetabolismProtein Structure, SecondarySequence Homology, Amino AcidTranscription FactorsgeneticsmetabolismTranscription, Genetic</MedlineCitation>

Like gastric inflammatory fibroid polyps, they can be managed by endoscopic polypectomy or mucosectomy. However, preoperative diagnosis of this benign lesion is difficult. Here we present a case of duodenal IFP causing gastrointestinal bleeding that was evaluated by endoscopic ultrasound before surgical removal. On endosonography, the duodenal IFP appeared as a coarsely heterogeneous isoechoic and hypoechoic mass circumscribed by a distinct margin and arising from the third layer of the duodenal wall. The endosonographic appearance of this lesion was in marked contrast to that previously reported for gastric IFPs, which have tended to appear as hypoechoic homogeneous lesions with indistinct margins. Endosonographic evaluation of suspected IFPs before endoscopic or surgical treatment is useful. However, the endosonographic appearances of duodenal and gastric IFPs may be significantly different, possibly because of differences in the makeup of the duodenal and gastric walls.SoonM SMSDivision of Gastroenterology, ChangHua Christian Medical Center, ChangHua, Taiwan.LinO SOSengCase ReportsJournal Article19991125GermanySurg Endosc88066530930-2794IMDuodenal NeoplasmscomplicationspathologysurgeryDuodenitisetiologypathologysurgeryEndoscopy, GastrointestinalEndosonographyFemaleFibromapathologysurgeryGastric MucosapathologyGastrointestinal HemorrhageetiologypathologysurgeryHumansIntestinal PolypscomplicationspathologysurgeryMiddle Aged</MedlineCitation>

Incubation of 11 in rat, dog, and human plasma and in human hepatic subcellular fractions in vitro indicated that conversion to 2 would be expected to occur in vivo most readily in humans during hepatic circulation. Conversion of 11 to 2 occurred rapidly in vivo in the rat and dog with the levels of 11 being undetectable within 5 min after 1 and 8 mg/kg doses iv in the rat and within 15 min after 0.5, 2, and 32 mg/kg doses iv in the dog. Compound 11 has a 10-fold lower affinity for the human NK-1 receptor as compared to 2, but it is functionally equivalent to 2 in preclinical models of NK-1-mediated inflammation in the guinea pig and cisplatin-induced emesis in the ferret, indicating that 11 acts as a prodrug of 2. Based in part on these data, 11 was identified as a novel, water-soluble prodrug of the clinical candidate 2 suitable for intravenous administration in humans.HaleJ JJJMerck Research Laboratories, P.O.

Mutat.Erratum: analysis of DNA elements that modulate myosin VIIa expression in humans.114-5Usher syndromeIb (USH1B), an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in myosin VIIa (MYO7A), is characterized by congenital profound hearing loss, vestibular abnormalities and retinitis pigmentosa. Promoter elements in the 5 kb upstream of the translation start were identified using adult retinal pigment epithelium cells (ARPE-19) as a model system. A 160 bp minimal promoter within the first intron was active in ARPE-19 cells, but not in HeLa cells that do not express MYO7A. A 100 bp sequence, 5' of the first exon, and repeated with 90% homology within the first intron, appeared to modulate expression in both cell lines. Segments containing these elements were screened by heteroduplex analysis. No heteroduplexes were detected in the minimal promoter, suggesting that this sequence is conserved. A -2568 A&gt;T transversion in the 5' 100 bp repeat, eliminating a CCAAT element, was found only in USH1B patients. However, in all 5 families, -2568 A&gt;T was in cis with the same missense mutation in the myosin VIIa tail (Arg1240Gln), and 4 of the 5 families were Dutch. These observations suggest either 1) linkage disequilibrium or 2)that a combination of a promoter mutation with a less active myosin VIIa protein results in USH1B.Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.OrtenD JDJCenter for Hereditary Communication Disorders, Boys Town National Research Hospital Omaha, NE, USA. ortend@boystown.orgWestonM DMDKelleyP MPMCremersC WCWWagenaarMMJacobsonS GSGKimberlingW JWJengDC00677DCNIDCD NIH HHSUnited StatesDC00982DCNIDCD NIH HHSUnited StatesDC03351DCNIDCD NIH HHSUnited StatesCorrected and Republished ArticleJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tResearch Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.United StatesHum Mutat92154291059-7794EC 3.6.4.1MyosinsEC 3.6.4.1myosin VIIaEC 3.6.4.2DyneinsIMHum Mutat. 1999 Oct;14(4):35410502787Amino Acid SubstitutionCell LineDyneinsGene Expression RegulationHeLa CellsHearing Loss, SensorineuralgeneticsmetabolismHumansLinkage DisequilibriumMutation, MissenseMyosinsbiosynthesisgeneticsPedigreePigment Epithelium of EyemetabolismPolymerase Chain ReactionPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment LengthPromoter Regions, GeneticRetinitis PigmentosageneticsmetabolismSyndromeVestibular Diseasesgeneticsmetabolism</MedlineCitation>

Carcinog.Altered expression of BRCA1, BRCA2, and a newly identified BRCA2 exon 12 deletion variant in malignant human ovarian, prostate, and breast cancer cell lines.236-46Germline mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 predispose to hereditary breast, ovarian, and possibly prostate cancer, yet structural mutations in these genes are infrequent in sporadic cancer cases. To better define the involvement of these genes in sporadic cancers, we characterized expression levels of BRCA1 and BRCA2 transcripts in cancer cell lines derived from neoplasms of the ovary, prostate, and breast and compared them with those expressed in primary cultures of normal epithelial cells established from these organs. We observed upregulation of BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 expression in six of seven ovarian cancer cell lines (OVCA420, OVCA429, OVCA432, ALST, DOV13, and SKOV3) when compared with levels found in normal ovary surface epithelial cells. Furthermore, five cancerous or immortalized prostatic epithelial cell lines (BPH-1, TSU-Pr1, LNCaP, PC-3, and DU145) also expressed higher levels of BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 mRNA than did primary cultures of normal prostatic epithelial cells. In contrast, only the estrogen receptor-positive MCF-7 cell line overexpressed these messages, whereas the estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer cell lines Hs578T, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468 showed no change in expression levels when compared with normal breast epithelial cells. In addition, expanding on our recent identification of a novel BRCA2 transcript variant carrying an in-frame exon 12 deletion (BRCA2 delta 12), we report increased expression of this variant in several ovarian, prostate, and mammary cancer cell lines (OVCA420, OVCA433, ALST, DOV13, SKOV3, TSU-Pr1, DU145, and MDA-MB-468). Most notably, high levels of BRCA2 delta 12 mRNA were detected in an estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cell line, MCF-7, and in an androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line, DU-145. Interestingly, the wild-type BRCA2 transcript was barely detectable in DU145, which could be used as a model system for future investigations on BRCA2 delta 12 function. Taken together, our data suggest disruption of BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 gene expression in certain epithelial cancer cell lines of the ovary, prostate, and breast. Because wild-type BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene products increase during cell-cycle progression and are believed to exert growth-inhibitory action, enhanced expression of these genes in cancer cells may represent a negative feedback mechanism for curbing proliferation in fast-growing cells. At present, the functionality of BRCA2 delta 12 remains elusive.Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.Rauh-AdelmannCCDepartment of Biology, Tufts University, Medford, Massachusetts, USA.LauK MKMSabetiNNLongJ PJPMokS CSCHoS MSMengC69453PHS HHSUnited StatesCA15576CANCI NIH HHSUnited StatesCA62269CANCI NIH HHSUnited StatesJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tResearch Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.United StatesMol Carcinog88111050899-19870BRCA1 Protein0BRCA2 Protein0Neoplasm Proteins0RNA, Messenger0Transcription FactorsIMBRCA1 ProteingeneticsBRCA2 ProteinBreastmetabolismBreast NeoplasmsgeneticsCell LineEpithelial CellsmetabolismExonsFemaleGene Expression Regulation, NeoplasticGenes, BRCA1Genetic VariationHumansMaleNeoplasm ProteinsgeneticsOvarian NeoplasmsgeneticsProstatic NeoplasmsgeneticsRNA, MessengergeneticsSequence DeletionTranscription FactorsgeneticsTranscription, GeneticTumor Cells, Cultured</MedlineCitation>

There is evidence from a range of studies to suggest that a number of factors relating to maternal psychosocial health can have a significant effect on the mother-infant relationship, and that this can have consequences for the psychological health of the child. It is now thought that parenting programmes may have an important role to play in the improvement of maternal psychosocial health.The objective of this review is to address whether group-based parenting programmes are effective in improving maternal psychosocial health including anxiety, depression and self-esteem.A range of biomedical, social science, educational and general reference electronic databases were searched including MEDLINE, EMBASE CINAHL, PsychLIT, ERIC, ASSIA, Sociofile and the Social Science Citation Index. Other sources of information included the Cochrane Library (SPECTR, CENTRAL), and the National Research Register (NRR).Only randomised controlled trials were included in which participants had been randomly allocated to an experimental and a control group, the latter being either a waiting-list, no-treatment or a placebo control group. Studies had to include at least one group-based parenting programme, and one standardised instrument measuring maternal psychosocial health.A systematic critical appraisal of all included studies was undertaken using the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) published criteria. The data were summarised using effect sizes but were not combined in a meta-analysis due to the small number of studies within each group and the presence of significant heterogeneity.A total of 22 studies were included in the review but only 17 provided sufficient data to calculate effect sizes. These 17 studies reported on a total of 59 outcomes including depression, anxiety, stress, self-esteem, social competence, social support, guilt, mood, automatic thoughts, dyadic adjustment, psychiatric morbidity, irrationality, anger and aggression, mood, attitude, personality, and beliefs. Approximately 22% of the outcomes measured suggested significant differences favouring the intervention group. A further 40% showed differences favouring the intervention group but which failed to achieve conventional levels of statistical significance, in some cases due to the small numbers that were used. Approximately 38% of outcomes suggested no evidence of effectiveness.It is suggested that parenting programmes can make a significant contribution to the improvement of psychosocial health in mothers. While the critical appraisal suggests some variability in the quality of the included studies, it is concluded that there is sufficient evidence to support their use with diverse groups of parents. However, it is also suggested that some caution should be exercised before the results are generalised to parents irrespective of the level of pathology present, and that further research is still required.BarlowJJHealth Services Research Unit, University of Oxford, Institute of Health Sciences, Old Road, Oxford, UK, OX3 7LF. esther.coren@dphpc.ox.ac.ukCorenEEengJournal ArticleReviewEnglandCochrane Database Syst Rev1009097471361-6137IMCochrane Database Syst Rev. 2001;(2):CD00202011406024AnxietytherapyDepressiontherapyFemaleHumansMaternal BehaviorpsychologyMother-Child RelationsParentingProgram EvaluationRandomized Controlled Trials as TopicSelf Concept99</MedlineCitation>

Immunol.Histamine induces exocytosis and IL-6 production from human lung macrophages through interaction with H1 receptors.4083-91Increasing evidence suggests that a continuous release of histamine from mast cells occurs in the airways of asthmatic patients and that histamine may modulate functions of other inflammatory cells such as macrophages. In the present study histamine (10(-9)-10(-6) M) increased in a concentration-dependent fashion the basal release of beta-glucuronidase (EC(50) = 8.2 +/- 3.5 x 10(-9) M) and IL-6 (EC(50) = 9.3 +/- 2.9 x 10(-8) M) from human lung macrophages. Enhancement of beta-glucuronidase release induced by histamine was evident after 30 min and peaked at 90 min, whereas that of IL-6 required 2-6 h of incubation. These effects were reproduced by the H(1) agonist (6-[2-(4-imidazolyl)ethylamino]-N-(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)heptane carboxamide but not by the H(2) agonist dimaprit. Furthermore, histamine induced a concentration-dependent increase of intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations ([Ca(2+)](i)) that followed three types of response, one characterized by a rapid increase, a second in which [Ca(2+)](i) displays a slow but progressive increase, and a third characterized by an oscillatory pattern. Histamine-induced beta-glucuronidase and IL-6 release and [Ca(2+)](i) elevation were inhibited by the selective H(1) antagonist fexofenadine (10(-7)-10(-4) M), but not by the H(2) antagonist ranitidine. Inhibition of histamine-induced beta-glucuronidase and IL-6 release by fexofenadine was concentration dependent and displayed the characteristics of a competitive antagonism (K(d) = 89 nM). These data demonstrate that histamine induces exocytosis and IL-6 production from human macrophages by activating H(1) receptor and by increasing [Ca(2+)](i) and they suggest that histamine may play a relevant role in the long-term sustainment of allergic inflammation in the airways.TriggianiMMDivision of Clinical Immunology and Allergy, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy. triggian@unina.itGentileMMSecondoAAGranataFFOrienteAATaglialatelaMMAnnunziatoLLMaroneGGengJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tUnited StatesJ Immunol2985117R0022-17670Histamine Agonists0Histamine H1 Antagonists0Histamine H2 Antagonists0Interleukin-60RNA, Messenger0Receptors, Histamine H10Toluidines103827-15-26-((2-(4-imidazolyl)ethyl)amino)heptanoic acid 4-toluidide820484N8I3HistamineEC 3.2.1.31GlucuronidaseSY7Q814VUPCalciumZZQ699148PDimapritAIMIMCalciummetabolismphysiologyCytosolmetabolismDimapritpharmacologyDose-Response Relationship, ImmunologicExocytosisimmunologyGlucuronidasesecretionHistamineanalogs &amp; derivativespharmacologyphysiologyHistamine AgonistspharmacologyHistamine H1 AntagonistspharmacologyHistamine H2 AntagonistspharmacologyHumansInterleukin-6biosynthesisgeneticssecretionLungcytologyenzymologyimmunologymetabolismMacrophages, AlveolarenzymologyimmunologymetabolismsecretionRNA, MessengerbiosynthesisReceptors, Histamine H1metabolismToluidinespharmacologyUp-Regulationimmunology</MedlineCitation>

Paucity of information about nutritional status of street children compared to that among urban slum dwellers, squatters or rural/tribal population is quite evident. The present study revealed the magnitude of Protein Energy Malnutrition (PEM) and few associated factors among a sample of 435 underfives belonging to pavement dweller families and selected randomly from clusters of such families, from each of the five geographical sectors of Calcutta city. Overall prevalence of PEM was found almost similar (about 70%) to that among other 'urban poor' children viz. slum dwellers etc., but about 16% of them were found severely undernourished (Grade III &amp; V of IAP classification of PEM). About 35% and 70% of street dweller children had wasting and stunting respectively. Severe PEM (Grade III &amp; IV) was more prevalent among 12-23 months old, girl child, those belonged to illiterate parents and housewife mothers rather than wage earners. It also did increase with increase of birth rate of decrease of birth interval.RayS KSKDepartment of Community Medicine, Medical College, Calcutta.MishraRRBiswasRRKumarSSHalderAAChatterjeeTTengJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tIndiaIndian J Public Health04006730019-557XIMJChild, PreschoolCluster AnalysisCross-Sectional StudiesEducational StatusFemaleHumansIndiaepidemiologyInfantMaleNutritional StatusPovertyPrejudicePrevalenceProtein-Energy Malnutritionepidemiology14371700288124This document presents a cross-sectional survey concerning the magnitude of protein energy malnutrition (PEM) and its associated factors among 435 under-5 pavement-dwelling children in Calcutta. Results revealed that 69.43% were undernourished and that 16% of them were suffering from severe malnutrition (grade III and IV of the Indian Academy of Pediatrics criteria for PEM). The 24-35 month age group had the highest prevalence of malnutrition (82.93%) followed by the 36-47 and 12-23 month age groups with prevalences of 76.19% and 74.03%, respectively. Prevalence of severe grade malnutrition was noted to be three times higher in females (24.76%) than males (8.45%), and among families it increased in direct proportion to birth rate and inverse proportion to birth interval. Moreover, children of illiterate parents and nonworking mothers had a higher incidence of severe PEM. Simple measures such as exclusive breast-feeding and timely complementary feeding as well as measures directed toward birth spacing and limiting family size should be implemented to solve the problem of malnutrition.Age FactorsAsiaChildChild NutritionDemographic FactorsDeveloping CountriesDiseasesGeographic FactorsHealthHomeless PersonsIndiaMalnutritionNutritionNutrition DisordersPopulationPopulation CharacteristicsResearch MethodologyResearch ReportResidence CharacteristicsSampling StudiesSouthern AsiaSpatial DistributionStudiesSurveysUrban PopulationYouthTJ: INDIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH.</MedlineCitation>

The use of parenting programmes is increasing in the UK and evidence of their effectiveness in improving outcomes for mothers is now required.The objective of this review is to address whether group-based parenting programmes are effective in improving maternal psychosocial health including anxiety, depression, and self-esteem.A range of biomedical, social science, educational and general reference electronic databases were searched including MEDLINE, EMBASE CINAHL, PsychLIT, ERIC, ASSIA, Sociofile and the Social Science Citation Index. Other sources of information included the Cochrane Library (SPECTR, CENTRAL), and the National Research Register (NRR).Only randomised controlled trials were included in which participants had been randomly allocated to an experimental and a control group, the latter being either a waiting-list, no-treatment or a placebo control group. Studies had to include at least one group-based parenting programme, and one standardised instrument measuring maternal psychosocial health.A systematic critical appraisal of all included studies was undertaken using a modified version of the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) published criteria. The treatment effect for each outcome in each study was standardised by dividing the mean difference in post-intervention scores for the intervention and treatment group, by the pooled standard deviation, to produce an effect size. Where appropriate the results were then combined in a meta-analysis using a fixed-effect model, and 95% confidence intervals were used to assess the significance of the findings.A total of 23 studies were included in the review but only 17 provided sufficient data to calculate effect sizes. The 17 studies provided a total of 59 assessments of outcome on a range of aspects of psychosocial functioning including depression, anxiety, stress, self-esteem, social competence, social support, guilt, mood, automatic thoughts, dyadic adjustment, psychiatric morbidity, irrationality, anger and aggression, mood, attitude, personality, and beliefs. There was only sufficient data, however, on five outcomes (depression; anxiety/stress; self-esteem; social support; and relationship with spouse/marital adjustment) to combine the results in a meta-analysis. The meta-analyses show statistically significant results favouring the intervention group as regards depression; anxiety/stress; self-esteem; and relationship with spouse/marital adjustment. The meta-analysis of the social support data, however, showed no evidence of effectiveness. These results suggest that parenting programmes, irrespective of the type (or content) of programme, can be effective in improving important aspects of maternal psycho-social functioning. Of the data summarising the effectiveness of the different types of parenting programmes, which it was not possible to combine in a meta-analysis, approximately 22% of the outcomes measured, showed significant differences between the intervention group and the control group. A further 40% showed medium to large non-significant differences favouring the intervention group. Approximately one-third of outcomes showed small non-significant differences or no evidence of effectiveness. A meta-analysis of the follow-up data on three outcomes was also conducted - depression, self-esteem and relationship with spouse/marital adjustment. The results show that there was a continued improvement in self-esteem, depression and marital adjustment at follow-up, although the latter two findings were not statistically significant.It is suggested that parenting programmes can make a significant contribution to short-term psychosocial health in mothers, and that the limited follow-up data available suggest that these are maintained over time. However, the overall paucity of long-term follow-up data points to the need for further evidence concerning the long-term effectiveness of parenting programmes on maternal mental health. Furthermore, it is suggested that some caution should be exercised before the results are generalised to parents irrespective of the level of pathology present, and that further research is still required.BarlowJJHealth Services Research Unit, University of Oxford, Institute of Health Sciences, Old Road, Headington, Oxford, UK, OX3 7LF. esther.coren@public-health.oxford.ac.ukCorenEEengJournal ArticleReviewEnglandCochrane Database Syst Rev1009097471361-6137IMCochrane Database Syst Rev. 2004;(1):CD00202014973981Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2000;(4):CD00202011034741AnxietytherapyDepressiontherapyFemaleHumansMaternal BehaviorpsychologyMaternal WelfareMother-Child RelationsParentingProgram EvaluationRandomized Controlled Trials as TopicSelf Concept100</MedlineCitation>

Assessment of a patient's quality of life (QoL) is now conceptually viewed as an important complement to traditional objective evaluation measures. It was therefore considered important to review the basis for the assessment of this endpoint when The Swedish Council of Technology Assessment in Health Care (SBU) performed a systematic overview of chemotherapy effects in several tumour types. The group came to the following conclusions: QoL assessments, mostly by patient self-reporting in questionnaires, have come increasingly into use during the past decade. A number of general, cancer-specific and cancer diagnosis-specific instruments have been developed. There is at present little need for development of new cancer instruments, although specific treatment modalities and tumour types may need new additional modules. A predefined hypothesis should determine the instrument to be used. Since the selection of a QoL instrument in a specific study influences both the results and the conclusions, it is essential to carefully select the instrument or instruments that have the greatest likelihood of identifying relevant differences between treatment alternatives. Interpretation of QoL data is more difficult than interpretation of objective endpoints such as survival time, objective response rates or toxicity. Despite these difficulties, QoL analyses have provided new insights into the advantages and disadvantages of various treatments not provided by traditional end-points. Some palliative treatments seemingly increase patients' QoL despite side-effects or the lack of, or marginal, increases in survival. When using potentially curative chemotherapy, it is not a matter of when the treatment should be started, but rather when it should be concluded. When using less active chemotherapy, the expected small therapeutic gains must be weighed against the QoL costs of using the therapy: does the toxicity and/or the inconvenience of the proposed treatment justify the expected gain? When it is found that the strain on the patient is greater than the effects of the cancer, treatment must be discontinued. It is not possible to determine whether or not the advantages of palliative chemotherapy are worth their costs without knowledge about patients' personal values regarding the influence on factors of relevance for QoL. The mostly used QoL questionnaires do not consider individual preferences, which therefore need to be addressed in the dialogue with the patient. QoL assessment is clearly in need of further methodological improvement before this endpoint can be regarded as fully established with respect to ability to provide unequivocally useful data in clinical trials. The multitude of questionnaires, missing data, lack of pre-study hypotheses of relevant differences between treatments and data multiplicity giving a risk for chance findings are examples of serious methodological problems. Patient response-shifts over time further complicate the interpretation of the data. Thus, QoL data, also from seemingly well-performed clinical trials, have to be interpreted cautiously. The international development during recent years has aimed at creating increased standardization of QoL measures. This has created greater possibilities to compare results from different trials. Hopefully, this also implies that it will be possible to draw firmer conclusions from QoL measurements in recently completed or ongoing trials than has been the case previously. QoL assessments are resource demanding even when short standardized questionnaires are used. Since cancer patients also generally give priority to anticancer effects over toxicity and convenience, QoL assessments in clinical trials are motivated mainly in study settings comparing treatments without expected major differences of outcome in objective endpoints.GunnarsBBDepartment of Oncology, University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.NygrenPPGlimeliusBBSBU-group.

Periodontol.Utilisation of locally delivered doxycycline in non-surgical treatment of chronic periodontitis. A comparative multi-centre trial of 2 treatment approaches.753-61In the present 6-month multicentre trial, the outcome of 2 different approaches to non-surgical treatment of chronic periodontitis, both involving the use of a locally delivered controlled-release doxycycline, was evaluated.105 adult patients with moderately advanced chronic periodontitis from 3 centres participated in the trial. Each patient had to present with at least 8 periodontal sites in 2 jaw quadrants with a probing pocket depth (PPD) of &gt; or =5 mm and bleeding following pocket probing (BoP), out of which at least 2 sites had to be &gt; or =7 mm and a further 2 sites &gt; or =6 mm. Following a baseline examination, including assessments of plaque, PPD, clinical attachment level (CAL) and BoP, careful instruction in oral hygiene was given. The patients were then randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: scaling/root planing (SRP) with local analgesia or debridement (supra- and subgingival ultrasonic instrumentation without analgesia). The "SRP" group received a single episode of full-mouth supra-/subgingival scaling and root planing under local analgesia. In addition, at a 3-month recall visit, a full-mouth supra-/subgingival debridement using ultrasonic instrumentation was provided. This was followed by subgingival application of an 8.5% w/w doxycycline polymer at sites with a remaining PPD of &gt; or =5 mm. The patients of the "debridement" group were initially subjected to a 45-minute full-mouth debridement with the use of an ultrasonic instrument and without administration of local analgesia, and followed by application of doxycycline in sites with a PPD of &gt; or =5 mm. At month 3, sites with a remaining PPD of &gt; or =5 mm were subjected to scaling and root planing. Clinical re-examinations were performed at 3 and 6 months.At 3 months, the proportion of sites showing PPD of &lt; or =4 mm was significantly higher in the "debridement" group than in the "SRP" group (58% versus 50%; p&lt;0.05). The CAL gain at 3 months amounted to 0.8 mm in the "debridement" group and 0.5 mm in the "SRP" group (p=0.064). The proportion of sites demonstrating a clinically significant CAL gain (&gt; or =2 mm) was higher in the "debridement" group than in the "SRP" group (38% versus 30%; p&lt;0.05). At the 6-month examination, no statistically significant differences in PPD or CAL were found between the two treatment groups. BoP was significantly lower for the "debridement" group than for the "SRP" group (p&lt;0.001) both at 3- and 6 months. The mean total treatment time (baseline and 3-month) for the "SRP" patients was 3:11 h, compared to 2:00 h for the patients in the "debridement" group (p&lt;0.001).The results indicate that simplified subgingival instrumentation combined with local application of doxycycline in deep periodontal sites can be considered as a justified approach for non-surgical treatment of chronic periodontitis.Wennstr&#xC3;&#xB6;mJ LJLDepartment of Periodontology, Institute of Odontology, G&#xC3;&#xB6;teborg University, SE 405 30 G&#xC3;&#xB6;teborg, Sweden. wennstrom@odontologi.gu.seNewmanH NHNMacNeillS RSRKilloyW JWJGriffithsG SGSGillamD GDGKrokLLNeedlemanI GIGWeissGGGarrettSSengfregerClinical TrialJournal ArticleMulticenter StudyRandomized Controlled TrialResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tUnited StatesJ Clin Periodontol04251230303-69790Anti-Bacterial AgentsN12000U13ODoxycyclineDIMAdultAgedAnti-Bacterial Agentsadministration &amp; dosageChronic DiseaseClinical ProtocolsCost-Benefit AnalysisDebridementDental ScalingmethodsDoxycyclineadministration &amp; dosageanalogs &amp; derivativesDrug CompoundingFemaleGingival HemorrhageetiologyHumansMaleMiddle AgedPeriodontal PocketpathologyPeriodontitiscomplicationsdrug therapypathologytherapyProspective StudiesRoot PlaningmethodsSingle-Blind MethodTreatment Outcome</MedlineCitation>

Torque removal forces have been used as a biomechanical measure of anchorage, or endosseous integration, in which the greater forces required to remove implants may be interpreted as an increase in the strength of bony integration. The purpose of this study was to compare the torque resistance to removal of screw-shaped titanium implants having a dual acid-etched surface (Osseotite) with implants having either a machined surface, or a titanium plasma spray surface that exhibited a significantly more complex surface topography. Three custom screw-shaped implant types - machined, dual acid-etched (DAE), and titanium plasma sprayed (TPS) - were used in this study. Each implant surface was characterized by scanning electron microscopy and optical profilometry. One DAE implant was placed into each distal femur of eighteen adult New Zealand White rabbits along with one of the other implant types. Thus, each rabbit received two DAE implants and one each of the machined, or TPS, implants. All implants measured 3.25 mm in diameter x 4.00 mm in length without holes, grooves or slots to resist rotation. Eighteen rabbits were used for reverse torque measurements. Groups of six rabbits were sacrificed following one, two and three month healing periods. Implants were removed by reverse torque rotation with a digital torque-measuring device. Three implants with the machined surface preparation failed to achieve endosseous integration. All other implants were anchored by bone. Mean torque values for machined, DAE and TPS implants at one, two and three months were 6.00+/-0.64 N-cm, 9.07+/-0.67 N-cm and 6.73+/-0.95 N-cm; 21.86+/-1.37 N-cm, 27.63+/-3.41 N-cm and 27.40+/-3.89 N-cm; and 27.48+/-1.61 N-cm, 44.28+/-4.53 N-cm and 59.23+/-3.88 N-cm, respectively. Clearly, at the earliest time point the stability of DAE implants was comparable to that of TPS implants, while that of the machined implants was an order of magnitude lower. The TPS implants increased resistance to reverse torque removal over the three-month period. The results of this study confirm our previous results that demonstrated enhanced bony anchorage to dual acid-etched implants as compared to machined implants. Furthermore, the present results indicate that dual acid etching of titanium enhances early endosseous integration to a level which is comparable to that achieved by the topographically more complex TPS surfaces.KlokkevoldP RPRDivision of Associated Specialties, Section of Periodontics, UCLA School of Dentistry, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA. pklok@ucla.eduJohnsonPPDadgostariSSCaputoAADaviesJ EJENishimuraR DRDengfregerComparative StudyJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDenmarkClin Oral Implants Res91057130905-71610Coated Materials, Biocompatible0Dental Implants0Sulfuric AcidsD1JT611TNETitaniumO40UQP6WCFsulfuric acidQTT17582CBHydrochloric AcidDAnalysis of VarianceAnimalsCoated Materials, BiocompatibleDental Implantation, EndosseousDental ImplantsDental PolishingDental Prosthesis DesignDevice RemovalFemurHydrochloric AcidImplants, ExperimentalMetallurgyOsseointegrationRabbitsSulfuric AcidsSurface PropertiesTitaniumTorque</MedlineCitation>

Chem.Evidence that ligand and metal ion binding to integrin alpha 4beta 1 are regulated through a coupled equilibrium.36520-9We have used the highly selective alpha(4)beta(1) inhibitor 2S-[(1-benzenesulfonyl-pyrrolidine-2S-carbonyl)-amino]-4-[4-methyl-2S-(methyl-[2-[4-(3-o-tolyl-ureido)-phenyl]-acetyl]-amino)-pentanoylamino]-butyric acid (BIO7662) as a model ligand to study alpha(4)beta(1) integrin-ligand interactions on Jurkat cells. Binding of [(35)S]BIO7662 to Jurkat cells was dependent on the presence of divalent cations and could be blocked by treatment with an excess of unlabeled inhibitor or with EDTA. K(D) values for the binding of BIO7662 to Mn(2+)-activated alpha(4)beta(1) and to the nonactivated state of the integrin that exists in 1 mm Mg(2+), 1 mm Ca(2+) were &lt;10 pm, indicating that it has a high affinity for both activated and nonactivated integrin. No binding was observed on alpha(4)beta(1) negative cells. Through an analysis of the metal ion dependences of ligand binding, several unexpected findings about alpha(4)beta(1) function were made. First, we observed that Ca(2+) binding to alpha(4)beta(1) was stimulated by the addition of BIO7662. From solution binding studies on purified alpha(4)beta(1), two types of Ca(2+)-binding sites were identified, one dependent upon and the other independent of BIO7662 binding. Second, we observed that the metal ion dependence of ligand binding was affected by the affinity of the ligand for alpha(4)beta(1). ED(50) values for the metal ion dependence of the binding of BIO7762 and the binding of a lower affinity ligand, BIO1211, differed by 2-fold for Mn(2+), 30-fold for Mg(2+), and &gt;1000-fold for Ca(2+). Low Ca(2+) (ED(50) = 5-10 microm) stimulated the binding of BIO7662 to alpha(4)beta(1). The effects of microm Ca(2+) closely resembled the effects of Mn(2+) on alpha(4)beta(1) function. Third, we observed that the rate of BIO7662 binding was dependent on the metal ion concentration and that the ED(50) for the metal ion dependence of BIO7662 binding was affected by the concentration of the BIO7662. These studies point to an even more complex interplay between metal ion and ligand binding than previously appreciated and provide evidence for a three-component coupled equilibrium model for metal ion-dependent binding of ligands to alpha(4)beta(1).ChenL LLLBiogen, Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts 02142, USA.WhittyAAScottDDLeeW CWCCornebiseMMAdamsS PSPPetterR CRCLobbR RRRPepinskyR BRBengJournal Article20010725United StatesJ Biol Chem2985121R0021-925802-((1-benzenesulfonylpyrrolidine-2-carbonyl)amino)-4-(4-methyl-2-(methyl-(2-(4-(3-o-tolylureido)phenyl)acetyl)amino)pentanoylamino)butyric acid0Benzoates0Cations0Dipeptides0Integrin alpha4beta10Integrins0Ions0Ligands0Phenylurea Compounds0Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing42Z2K6ZL8PManganese9G34HU7RV0Edetic AcidI38ZP9992AMagnesiumSY7Q814VUPCalciumIMBenzoatespharmacologyCalciummetabolismpharmacologyCationsDipeptidespharmacologyDose-Response Relationship, DrugEdetic AcidpharmacologyHumansIntegrin alpha4beta1Integrinsantagonists &amp; inhibitorschemistrymetabolismIonsJurkat CellsKineticsLigandsMagnesiumpharmacologyManganesepharmacologyModels, ChemicalPhenylurea CompoundspharmacologyProtein BindingReceptors, Lymphocyte Homingantagonists &amp; inhibitorschemistrymetabolismTime Factors</MedlineCitation>

A report of two cases.379-84Porous beta-phase tricalcium phosphate particles (pTCP) (Cerasorb) were used in two patients to restore or augment alveolar bone prior to the placement of dental implants. In one patient, pTCP was used to fill a large alveolar defect in the posterior mandible after the removal of a residual cyst, and in another patient to augment the sinus floor. Biopsies were taken at the time of implant placement, 9.5 and 8 months after grafting, respectively, and processed for hard tissue histology. Goldner-stained histological sections showed considerable replacement of the bone substitute by bone and bone marrow. In the 9.5 months biopsy of the mandible, 34% of the biopsy consisted of mineralised bone tissue and 29% of remaining pTCP, while the biopsy at 8 months after sinus floor augmentation consisted of 20% mineralised bone and 44% remaining pTCP. Bone and osteoid were lying in close contact with the remaining pTCP and were also seen within the micropores of the grafted particles. Tartrate resistant-acid phosphatase (TRAP) multinuclear cells, presumably osteoclasts, were found surrounding, within and in close contact with the pTCP particles, suggesting active resorption of the bone substitute. Remodelling of immature woven bone into mature lamellar bone was also found. No histological signs of inflammation were detected. The limited data presented from these two cases suggest that this graft material, possibly by virtue of its porosity and chemical nature, may be a suitable bone substitute that can biodegrade and be replaced by new mineralising bone tissue.ZerboI RIRDepartment of Oral Cell Biology, ACTA, Vrije Universiteit, Vander Boechorststraat 7, 1081 BT Amsterdam, Netherlands.

Chem.Novel azo derivatives as prodrugs of 5-aminosalicylic acid and amino derivatives with potent platelet activating factor antagonist activity.3001-13This paper describes the synthesis of a series of azo compounds able to deliver 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) and a potent platelet activating factor (PAF) antagonist in a colon-specific manner for the purpose of treating ulcerative colitis. We found it possible to add an amino group on the aromatic moiety of our reported 1-[(1-acyl-4-piperidyl)methyl]-1H-2-methylimidazo[4,5-c]pyridine derivatives or on British Biotech compounds BB-882 and BB-823 maintaining a high level of activity as PAF antagonist. A selected compound UR-12715 (49c) showed an IC(50) of 8 nM in the in vitro PAF-induced aggregation assay, and an ID(50) of 29 microg/kg in the in vivo PAF-induced hypotension test in normotensive rats. Through attachment of 49c to the 5-ASA via azo functionality we obtained UR-12746 (70). Pharmacokinetics experiments with [14C]-70 allow us to reach the following conclusions, critical in the design of these new prodrugs of 5-ASA. Neither the whole molecule 70 nor the carrier 49c were absorbed after oral administration of [14C]-70 in rat as was demonstrated by the absence of plasma levels of radioactivity and the high recovery of it in feces. Effective cleavage of azo bond (84%) by microflora in the colon is achieved. These facts ensure high topical concentrations of 5-ASA and 49c in the colon. Additionally, 70 exhibited a potent anticolitic effect in the trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-induced colitis model in the rat. This profile suggests that UR-12746 (70) provides an attractive new approach to the treatment of ulcerative colitis.CarcellerEEResearch Center, J.

Mutat.Detection of six novel FBN1 mutations in British patients affected by Marfan syndrome.251Marfan syndrome (MFS), an autosomal dominant disorder of the extracellular matrix, is due to mutations in fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene. Investigations carried out in the last decade, unveiled the unpredictability of the site of the mutation, which could be anywhere in the gene. FBN1 mutations have been reported in a spectrum of diseases related to MFS, with no clear evidence for a phenotype-genotype correlation. In this paper we analysed 10 British patients affected by MFS and we were able to characterise five novel missense mutations (C474W, C1402Y, G1987R, C2153Y, G2536R), one novel frameshift mutation (7926delC), one already described mutation (P1424A) and one FBN1 variant (P1148A) classified as a polymorphism in the Asian population. Four out of the five novel missense mutations involved either cysteines or an amino acid conserved in the domain structure. The mutation yield in this study is calculated at 80.0% (8/10), thus indicating that SSCA is a reliable and cost-effective technique for the screening of such a large gene. Our results suggest that this method is reliable to search for FBN1 mutations and that FBN1 screening could be a helpful tool to confirm and possibly anticipate the clinical diagnosis in familial cases.

We measured cytoplasmic free calcium in protoplasts isolated from the elongation zone and cap of primary roots of light-grown, vertically oriented seedlings of Zea mays L. Protoplasts were loaded with the penta-potassium salts of fura-2 and indo-1 by incubation in acidic solutions of these calcium indicators. Loading increased with decreasing pH but the pH dependence was stronger for indo-1 than for fura-2. In the case of fura-2, loading was enhanced only at the lowest pH (4.5) tested. Dyes loaded in this manner were distributed predominantly in the cytoplasm as indicated by fluorescence patterns. As an alternative method of loading, protoplasts were incubated with the acetoxymethylesters of fura-2 and indo-1. Protoplasts loaded by this method exhibited fluorescence both in the cytoplasm and in association with various organelles. Cytoplasmic calcium levels measured using spectrofluorometry, were found to be 160 +/- 40 nM and 257 +/- 27 nM, respectively, in populations of protoplasts from the root cap and elongation zone. Cytoplasmic free calcium did not increase upon addition of calcium to the incubation medium, indicating that the passive permeability to calcium was low.KissH GHGDepartment of Plant Biology, Ohio State University, Columbus.EvansM LMLJohnsonJ DJDengDMB 8608673MBBHP HRSA HHSUnited StatesJournal ArticleResearch Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.AustriaProtoplasma98068530033-183X0Fluorescent Dyes0IndolesN18RMK75W1indo-1SY7Q814VUPCalciumTSN3DL106GFura-2SPlant Physiol. 1990;92:792-611537998Plant Physiol. 1988;87:803-511537876Plant Physiol. 1989;89:875-811537451Stain Technol. 1985 Mar;60(2):69-792580370Plant Physiol. 1983 Dec;73(4):874-616663333Plant Physiol. 1982 Nov;70(5):1391-516662685Plant Physiol. 1989 Aug;90(4):1271-416666921Planta. 1984;160:536-4311540830Plant Physiol. 1988;86:885-911538239Plant Physiol. 1990 Jul;93(3):841-516667590Science. 1983 Jun 24;220(4604):1375-617730651CRC Crit Rev Plant Sci. 1987;6(1):47-10311540070J Biol Chem. 1985 Mar 25;260(6):3440-503838314Plant Physiol. 1989 Jun;90(2):482-9116666797Planta. 1988 Dec;174(4):495-924221565Anal Biochem. 1985 May 1;146(2):349-523927770Sci Am. 1986 Dec;255(6):112-911536593Cell Calcium. 1987 Dec;8(6):455-723435914Plant Physiol. 1981 Aug;68(2):435-816661931Plant Physiol. 1984 Oct;76(2):342-616663844Nature. 1990 Jun 7;345:528-3011540625CalciumanalysisphysiologyCytoplasmchemistryFluorescent DyesFura-2GravitropismphysiologyGravity SensingphysiologyIndolesPlant Root Capcytologygrowth &amp; developmentphysiologyPlant Rootscytologygrowth &amp; developmentphysiologyProtoplastschemistryphysiologySignal TransductionZea mayscytologygrowth &amp; developmentphysiology00015446NASA Discipline Number 40-50NASA Discipline Plant BiologyNASA Program Space BiologyNon-NASA CenterEvansM LMLOhio St U, Columbus, Dept Physiological ChemistryGrant numbers: NAGW 297</MedlineCitation>

Immunol.The origin of Palestinians and their genetic relatedness with other Mediterranean populations.889-900The genetic profile of Palestinians has, for the first time, been studied by using human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene variability and haplotypes. The comparison with other Mediterranean populations by using neighbor-joining dendrograms and correspondence analyses reveal that Palestinians are genetically very close to Jews and other Middle East populations, including Turks (Anatolians), Lebanese, Egyptians, Armenians, and Iranians. Archaeologic and genetic data support that both Jews and Palestinians came from the ancient Canaanites, who extensively mixed with Egyptians, Mesopotamian, and Anatolian peoples in ancient times. Thus, Palestinian-Jewish rivalry is based in cultural and religious, but not in genetic, differences. The relatively close relatedness of both Jews and Palestinians to western Mediterranean populations reflects the continuous circum-Mediterranean cultural and gene flow that have occurred in prehistoric and historic times. This flow overtly contradicts the demic diffusion model of western Mediterranean populations substitution by agriculturalists coming from the Middle East in the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition.Arnaiz-VillenaAADepartment of Immunology and Molecular Biology, H. 12 de Octubre, Universidad Complutense, Madrid, Spain. aarnaiz@eucmax.sim.ucm.esElaiwaNNSilveraCCRostomAAMoscosoJJG&#xC3;&#xB3;mez-CasadoEEAllendeLLVarelaPPMart&#xC3;&#xAD;nez-LasoJJengComparative StudyJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tRetracted PublicationUnited StatesHum Immunol80109360198-88590HLA Antigens0HLA-A Antigens0HLA-B Antigens0HLA-DQ Antigens0HLA-DQ beta-Chains0HLA-DQB1 antigen0HLA-DR Antigens0HLA-DRB1 ChainsIMHum Immunol. 2001 Oct;62(10):106411600211Suciu-Foca N, Lewis R.

Yet changes in shear waveforms observed after an eruption of Mount Ruapehu, New Zealand, suggest that forces generated by such volcanoes are powerful and dynamic enough to locally overprint the regional stress regime, which suggests a new method of monitoring volcanoes for future eruptions. These results show a change in shear-wave polarization with time and are interpreted as being due to a localized stress regime caused by the volcano, with a release in pressure after the eruption.MillerVVInstitute of Geophysics, Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand.SavageMMengJournal ArticleUnited StatesScience04045110036-8075</MedlineCitation>

In the late-time regime its value measured relative to the evolving average height scales like the roughness: h*(L) approximately L alpha. For large values its distribution obeys logP(h*(L)) approximately (-)A(h*(L)/L(alpha))(a). In the early-time regime where the roughness grows as t(beta), we find h*(L) approximately t(beta)[lnL-(beta/alpha)lnt+C](1/b), where either b = a or b is the corresponding exponent of the velocity distribution. These properties are derived from scaling and extreme-value arguments.

Nevertheless, our inherent drive to simplify nature often causes us to suppose most impacts are nearly vertical. Recent theoretical, observational, and experimental work is improving this situation, but even with the current wealth of studies on impact cratering, the effect of impact angle on the final crater is not well understood. Although craters' rims may appear circular down to low impact angles, the distribution of ejecta around the crater is more sensitive to the angle of impact and currently serves as the best guide to obliquity of impacts. Experimental studies established that crater dimensions depend only on the vertical component of the impact velocity. The shock wave generated by the impact weakens with decreasing impact angle. As a result, melting and vaporization depend on impact angle; however, these processes do not seem to depend on the vertical component of the velocity alone. Finally, obliquity influences the fate of the projectile: in particular, the amount and velocity of ricochet are a strong function of impact angle.PierazzoEELunar and Planetary Lab., University of Arizona, Tucson, 84721, USA. betty@lpl.arizona.eduMeloshH JHJengJournal ArticleResearch Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.ReviewUnited StatesAnnu Rev Earth Planet Sci1009714650084-6597SComputer SimulationEvolution, PlanetaryGravitationMeteoroidsModels, TheoreticalMoonPlanets9600026602NASA Discipline ExobiologyNon-NASA CenterMeloshH JHJU AZ, TucsonGrant numbers: NAGW-5159, NAGW-428.</MedlineCitation>

Using these modern methods, the pharmaceutical industry with strong academic and government collaboration has introduced in the last 25 years many new drugs that approach the ideal. After reviewing Bj&#xC3;&#xB6;rnsson's classification of drug action and the notion of contributory causality, this commentary defines an ideal drug from the perspectives of pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and therapeutics. Examples of new drugs for hypertension, heart disease, stroke, osteoporosis, asthma, ulcer, and migraine headaches are described. Finally, the profound implications of progress in developing ideal drugs not only for the patient but also for the academic, educational, and regulatory establishments are briefly reviewed.Copyright 2002 S.

Mutat.Erratum: Detection of six novel FBN1 mutations in British patients affected by Marfan syndrome.546-7Marfan syndrome (MFS), an autosomal dominant disorder of the extracellular matrix, is due to mutations in fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene. Investigations carried out in the last decade, unveiled the unpredictability of the site of the mutation, which could be anywhere in the gene. FBN1 mutations have been reported in a spectrum of diseases related to MFS, with no clear evidence for a phenotype-genotype correlation. In this paper we analysed 10 British patients affected by MFS and we were able to characterise five novel missense mutations (C474W, C1402Y, G1987R, C2153Y, G2536R), one novel frameshift mutation (7926delC), one already described mutation (P1424A) and one FBN1 variant (P1148A) classified as a polymorphism in the Asian population. Four out of the five novel missense mutations involved either cysteines or an amino acid conserved in the domain structure. The mutation yield in this study is calculated at 80.0% (8/10), thus indicating that SSCA is a reliable and cost-effective technique for the screening of such a large gene. Our results suggest that this method is reliable to search for FBN1 mutations and that FBN1 screening could be a helpful tool to confirm and possibly anticipate the clinical diagnosis in familial cases.Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.ComeglioPPDepartment of Cardiological Sciences, St. George's Hospital Medical School, London, UK. p.comeglio@sghms.ac.ukEvansA LALBriceG WGWChildA HAHengJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tCorrected and Republished ArticleUnited StatesHum Mutat92154291059-77940FBN1 protein, human0Fibrillin-10Fibrillins0Microfilament Proteins9007-49-2DNAIMHum Mutat. 2001 Sep;18(3):25111524736AdultBase SequenceChild, PreschoolDNAchemistrygeneticsDNA Mutational AnalysisFemaleFibrillin-1FibrillinsFrameshift MutationHumansMaleMarfan SyndromegeneticspathologyMicrofilament ProteinsgeneticsMiddle AgedMutationMutation, MissensePolymorphism, GeneticPolymorphism, Single-Stranded ConformationalUnited Kingdom</MedlineCitation>

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration committed to conducting a multidisciplinary long-duration research program on a platform whose capabilities were not well known, not to mention belonging to another country. For the United States, it provided the first opportunity to conduct research in a long-duration space flight environment since the Skylab program in the 1970's. Multiple technical as well as cultural challenges were successfully overcome through the dedicated efforts of a relatively small cadre of individuals. The program developed processes to successfully plan, train for and execute research in a long-duration environment, with significant differences identified from short-duration space flight science operations. Between August 1994 and June 1998, thousands of kilograms of research hardware was prepared and launched to Mir, and thousands of kilograms of hardware and data products were returned to Earth. More than 150 Principal Investigators from eight countries were involved in the program in seven major research disciplines: Advanced Technology; Earth Sciences; Fundamental Biology; Human Life Sciences; International Space Station Risk Mitigation; Microgravity; and Space Sciences. Approximately 75 long-duration investigations were completed on Mir, with additional investigations performed on the Shuttle flights that docked with Mir. The flight phase included the participation of seven US astronauts and 20 Russian cosmonauts. The successful completion of the Phase 1 research program not only resulted in high quality science return but also in numerous lessons learned to make the ISS experience more productive. The cooperation developed during the program was instrumental in its success.c2001 AIAA.

This article presents recipes of products made from sweet potato and determines the consumer acceptability of products containing from 6% to 20% sweet potato on a dry weight basis. These products were developed for use in nutritious and palatable meals for future space explorers. Sensory evaluation (appearance/color, aroma, texture, flavor/taste, and overall acceptability) studies were conducted to determine the consumer acceptability of vegetarian products made with sweet potato using panelists at NASA/Johnson Space Center in Houston, TX. None of these products including the controls, contained any ingredient of animal origin with the exception of sweet potato pie. A 9-point hedonic scale (9 being like extremely and 1 being dislike extremely) was used to evaluate 10 products and compare them to similar commercially available products used as controls. The products tested were pancakes, waffles, tortillas, bread, pie, pound cake, pasta, vegetable patties, doughnuts, and pretzels. All of the products were either liked moderately or liked slightly with the exception of the sweet potato vegetable patties, which were neither liked nor disliked. Mean comparisons of sensory scores of sweet potato recipes and their controls were accomplished by using the Student t-test. Because of their nutritional adequacy and consumer acceptability, these products are being recommended to NASA's Advanced Life Support Program for inclusion in a vegetarian menu plan designed for lunar/Mars space missions.WilsonC DCDCenter for Food and Environmental Systems for Human Exploration of Space, George Washington Carver Agricultural Experiment Station, Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, AL 36088, USA.PaceR DRDBromfieldEEJonesGGLuJ YJYengJournal ArticleResearch Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.United StatesLife Support Biosph Sci94312171069-9422SDiet, VegetarianpsychologyEcological Systems, ClosedEvaluation Studies as TopicFeeding BehaviorpsychologyFood PreferencespsychologyFood TechnologyHumansIpomoea batatasLife Support SystemsMenu PlanningNutritive ValueSpace FlightUnited StatesUnited States National Aeronautics and Space AdministrationWeightlessness00027330NASA Discipline Life Support SystemsNon-NASA CenterMortleyD GDGTuskegee U, ALGrant numbers: NCC 9-51, ALX-FS-2.</MedlineCitation>

Biol.The major subacrosomal occupant of bull spermatozoa is a novel histone H2B variant associated with the forming acrosome during spermiogenesis.376-87Recent studies on the structural composition of mammalian sperm heads have shown a congregate of unidentified proteins occupying the periphery of the mammalian sperm nucleus, forming a layer of condensed cytosol. These proteins are the perinuclear theca (PT) and can be categorized into SDS-soluble and SDS-insoluble components. The present study focused on identifying the major SDS-insoluble PT protein, which we localized to the subacrosomal layer of bovine spermatozoa and cloned by immunoscreening a bull testicular cDNA library. The isolated clones encode a protein of 122 amino acids that bears 67% similarity with histone H2B and contains a predicted histone fold motif. The novel amino terminus of the protein contains a potential bipartite nuclear targeting sequence. Hence, we identified this prominent subacrosomal component as a novel H2B variant, SubH2Bv. Northern blot analyses of SubH2Bv mRNA expression showed that it is testis-specific and is also present in murid testes. Immunocytochemical analysis showed SubH2Bv intimately associates, temporally and spatially, with acrosome formation. While the molecular features of SubH2Bv are common to nuclear proteins, it is never seen developmentally within the nucleus of the spermatid. Considering its developmental and molecular characteristics, we have postulated roles of SubH2Bv in acrosome assembly and acrosome-nuclear docking.Copyright 2001 Academic Press.AulRitu BRBDepartment of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada, K7L 3N6.OkoRichard JRJengCorrected and Republished ArticleJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tUnited StatesDev Biol03727620012-16060DNA, Complementary0Histones0RNA, Messenger63231-63-0RNAIMDev Biol. 2001 Nov 15;239(2):376-8711784042AcrosomechemistrymetabolismultrastructureAmino Acid MotifsAmino Acid SequenceAnimalsBase SequenceBlotting, NorthernBlotting, WesternCattleDNA, ComplementarymetabolismElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide GelHistoneschemistryImmunoblottingImmunohistochemistryMaleMiceMolecular Sequence DataRNAmetabolismRNA, MessengermetabolismRatsReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain ReactionSeminiferous EpitheliummetabolismSequence Homology, Amino AcidSpermatogenesisSpermatozoachemistryTestismetabolism</MedlineCitation>

A primary objective was to develop a new approach to broaden participation in the consensus process.Forum groups composed of 6 to 10 individuals were responsible for developing recommendations for discussion at the workshop. Each forum group included at least 1 cytopathologist, cytotechnologist, clinician, and international representative to ensure a broad range of views and interests. More than 400 cytopathologists, cytotechnologists, histopathologists, family practitioners, gynecologists, public health physicians, epidemiologists, patient advocates, and attorneys participated in the workshop, which was convened by the National Cancer Institute and cosponsored by 44 professional societies. More than 20 countries were represented.Literature review, expert opinion, and input from an Internet bulletin board were all considered in developing recommendations. The strength of evidence of the scientific data was considered of paramount importance.Bethesda 2001 was a year-long iterative review process. An Internet bulletin board was used for discussion of issues and drafts of recommendations. More than 1000 comments were posted to the bulletin board over the course of 6 months. The Bethesda Workshop, held April 30-May 2, 2001, was open to the public. Postworkshop recommendations were posted on the bulletin board for a last round of critical review prior to finalizing the terminology.Bethesda 2001 was developed with broad participation in the consensus process.

In addition to the usual forward contamination procedures for the adequate protection of Mars for the sake of future missions, there are reasons to ensure that the sample is not contaminated by terrestrial microbes from the acquisition mission. Recent recommendations by the Space Studies Board (SSB) of the National Research Council (United States), would indicate that the scientific integrity of the sample is a planetary protection concern (SSB, 1997). Also, as a practical matter, a contaminated sample would interfere with the process for its release from quarantine after return for distribution to the interested scientists. These matters are discussed in terms of the first planned acquisition mission.c2001 COSPAR Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Chem.Interaction between FtsZ and FtsW of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.24983-7The recruitment of FtsZ to the septum and its subsequent interaction with other cell division proteins in a spatially and temporally controlled manner are the keys to bacterial cell division. In the present study, we have tested the hypothesis that FtsZ and FtsW of Mycobacterium tuberculosis could be binding partners. Using gel renaturation, pull-down, and solid-phase assays, we confirm that FtsZ and FtsW interact through their C-terminal tails, which carry extensions absent in their Escherichia coli counterparts. Crucial to these interactions is the cluster of aspartate residues Asp(367) to Asp(370) of FtsZ, which most likely interact with a cluster of positively charged residues in the C-terminal tail of FtsW. Mutations of the aspartate residues 367-370 showed that changing three aspartate residues to alanine resulted in complete loss of interaction. This is the first demonstration of the direct interaction between FtsZ and FtsW. We speculate that this interaction between FtsZ and FtsW could serve to anchor FtsZ to the membrane and link septum formation to peptidoglycan synthesis in M. tuberculosis. The findings assume particular significance in view of the global efforts to explore new targets in M. tuberculosis for chemotherapeutic intervention.DattaPratikPDepartment of Chemistry, Bose Institute, 93/1 Acharya Prafulla Chandra Road, Kolkata 700009, India.DasguptaArunavaABhaktaSanjibSBasuJoyotiJengJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't20020506United StatesJ Biol Chem2985121R0021-92580Bacterial Proteins0Cytoskeletal Proteins0DNA Primers0FtsZ protein, Bacteria0Membrane Proteins125724-13-2FtsW protein, BacteriaIMAmino Acid SequenceBacterial ProteinschemistrymetabolismBase SequenceCytoskeletal ProteinsDNA PrimersMembrane ProteinsMolecular Sequence DataMycobacterium tuberculosismetabolismProtein Binding</MedlineCitation>

Chem.Amisyn, a novel syntaxin-binding protein that may regulate SNARE complex assembly.28271-9The regulation of SNARE complex assembly likely plays an important role in governing the specificity as well as the timing of membrane fusion. Here we identify a novel brain-enriched protein, amisyn, with a tomosyn- and VAMP-like coiled-coil-forming domain that binds specifically to syntaxin 1a and syntaxin 4 both in vitro and in vivo, as assessed by co-immunoprecipitation from rat brain. Amisyn is mostly cytosolic, but a fraction co-sediments with membranes. The amisyn coil domain can form SNARE complexes of greater thermostability than can VAMP2 with syntaxin 1a and SNAP-25 in vitro, but it lacks a transmembrane anchor and so cannot act as a v-SNARE in this complex. The amisyn coil domain prevents the SNAP-25 C-terminally mediated rescue of botulinum neurotoxin E inhibition of norepinephrine exocytosis in permeabilized PC12 cells to a greater extent than it prevents the regular exocytosis of these vesicles. We propose that amisyn forms nonfusogenic complexes with syntaxin 1a and SNAP-25, holding them in a conformation ready for VAMP2 to replace it to mediate the membrane fusion event, thereby contributing to the regulation of SNARE complex formation.ScalesSuzie JSJHoward Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California 94305-5345, USA.HesserBoris ABAMasudaEsteban SESSchellerRichard HRHengGENBANKAF391153Journal Article20020524United StatesJ Biol Chem2985121R0021-92580Carrier Proteins0Membrane Proteins0Nerve Tissue Proteins0Qa-SNARE Proteins0Recombinant Fusion Proteins0SNAP25 protein, human0SNARE Proteins0STX1A protein, human0STXBP6 protein, human0Snap25 protein, rat0Stx1a protein, rat0Synaptosomal-Associated Protein 250Syntaxin 10Vesicular Transport ProteinsEC 2.5.1.18Glutathione TransferaseX4W3ENH1CVNorepinephrineIMAmino Acid SequenceAnimalsBinding SitesCarrier ProteinschemistrygeneticsphysiologyExocytosisGlutathione TransferasegeneticsHeLa CellsHumansKineticsMembrane ProteinschemistrymetabolismphysiologyMolecular Sequence DataNerve Tissue ProteinschemistrymetabolismNorepinephrineantagonists &amp; inhibitorssecretionPC12 CellsPheochromocytomaProtein Structure, SecondaryQa-SNARE ProteinsRatsRecombinant Fusion ProteinsmetabolismSNARE ProteinsSequence AlignmentSequence Homology, Amino AcidSynaptosomal-Associated Protein 25Syntaxin 1ThermodynamicsVesicular Transport Proteins</MedlineCitation>

Various intelligent planning systems have been developed within the framework of artificial intelligence. These planning systems generally lack a rigorous mathematical formalism to allow a reliable and flexible methodology for their design, modeling, and performance analysis in a dynamical, time-critical, and multiconstrained environment. Formulating the planning problem in the domain of discrete-event systems under a unified framework such that it can be modeled, designed, and analyzed as a control system will provide a self-contained theory for such planning systems. This will also provide a means to certify various planning systems for operations in the dynamical and complex environments in space. The work presented here completes the design, development, and analysis of an intricate, large-scale, and representative mathematical formulation for intelligent control of a real planning system for Space Station crew training.

A national family planning program and socioeconomic development have played roles in this decline. Should this most recent TFR prevail, the nation's population will increase to 50.2 million by 2020, shifting to negative growth thereafter. Demographic aging and labor shortages will ensue. Future population policy should consider Korea's socioeconomic conditions and its burgeoning population in relation to the available land area, and aim to maintain a minimum positive population growth rate. In this context, this paper considers future population policy directions for Korea, acknowledging that its strategies and objectives must change. Postponing reaching the goal of zero population growth rate is suggested to allow a moderate population infusion of economically active individuals. These people will help facilitate greater economic development and work to improve the quality of life in Korea. Strengthened family planning/maternal-child health programs which encourage and support temporary contraceptive methods instead of sterilization will help to achieve this goal. Improving qualitative program aspects should be the center of attention in these programs. The paper also calls upon the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs to strengthen its research and evaluation capabilities.AdultAge FactorsAgedAsiaBirth RateCarrying CapacityContraceptionContraceptive MethodsDelivery Of Health CareDemographic AgingDemographic FactorsDemographic TransitionDependency BurdenDeveloping CountriesEastern AsiaEconomic DevelopmentEconomic FactorsEnvironmentFamily PlanningFamily Planning ProgramsFertilityFertility MeasurementsFertility RateHealthHealth ServicesHuman ResourcesKoreaLabor ForceMacroeconomic FactorsMaternal-child Health ServicesMicroeconomic FactorsNatural ResourcesOrganization And AdministrationPolicyPopulationPopulation CharacteristicsPopulation DecreasePopulation DynamicsPopulation GrowthPopulation PolicyPopulation PressurePopulation SizePrimary Health CareProgram EvaluationProgramsPublic SectorResearch MethodologySocial PolicySocial WelfareSocioeconomic FactorsSterilization, SexualTotal Fertility Rate--changesZero Population GrowthTJ: JOURNAL OF POPULATION, HEALTH AND SOCIAL WELFARE</MedlineCitation>

The present commentary responds to several of their claims. It explains why an analogy between kidneys and blood fails; why, as a matter of public policy, we prohibit the sale of human solid organs, yet allow the sale of blood; and why their attack on Kant's putative argument against the sale of human body parts is misplaced. Finally, it rejects the claim that the state is entitled to interfere with the actions of individuals only if such actions would harm others. We draw certain lines grounded in what Rawls has termed "public reason" beyond which we do not give effect to the autonomous self-regarding decisions of individuals. Public resistance to the sale of human body parts, no matter how voluntary or well informed, is grounded in the conviction that such a practice would diminish human dignity and our sense of solidarity. A system of organ donation, in contrast, conveys our respect for persons and honors our common humanity.CohenCynthia BCBKennedy Institute of Ethics, Georgetown University, Washington, DC, USA.engJournal ArticleUnited StatesKennedy Inst Ethics J91091351054-6863EBlood DonorsCommodificationEthical AnalysisFees and ChargesHuman BodyHumansKidneyKidney TransplantationeconomicsLiving DonorsPublic PolicyTissue and Organ ProcurementeconomicsUnited States103573Analytical ApproachHealth Care and Public Health24 refs. 4 fn.KIE Bib: blood donation; organ and tissue donation</MedlineCitation>

He linked these tendencies both to the rise of capitalism and the growth of experimental science. The detailed case study of Paracelsus' account of diseases linked with saints, in common with his interpretation of many other conditions, demonstrates that he self-consciously extended the boundaries of medicine and eroded the role of magic and witchcraft associated with the church. On the other hand, Paracelsus adopted the Neoplatonic worldview, was immersed in popular magic, and evolved a system of medicine that self-consciously revolved around magic. These factors seem to place a distinct limit on his role in the demystification of knowledge. However, the magic of Paracelsus entailed a decisive break with the entrenched elitist and esoteric tradition of the occultists and hermeticists. It is argued that this reconstructed magic re-establishes the credentials of Paracelsus as a significant contributor to the disenchantment and secularization of the worldview.WebsterCharlesCAll Souls College, Oxford.engBiographyHistorical ArticleJournal ArticleEnglandSci Context89041130269-8897QEuropeHistory, 17th CenturyHistory, 20th CenturyHistory, Early Modern 1451-1600MagichistoryMedicinePhilosophyhistoryReligion and MedicineSciaticahistoryParacelsusWeberMaxM</MedlineCitation>

A number of structures have been erected to achieve this imbalance, which have disguised its inequity by making it appear as natural and universal. However, with globalization, this centralization of power within the Sovereign State has been fragmented. Although globalization opens up new spaces by weakening the nation-State, subsequently making possible the undermining of traditional gender hierarchies and devising new bases for gender relations, the reality that the State is no longer the sole institution that can define identity and belonging within it has denied women the space to assert their own claims to gendered self-determination. In this regard, globalization has impacted upon gender relations in complex and contradictory ways. This paper discusses such impacts of globalization on gender relations. Overall, it has become apparent that forms of inequality still exist regardless of a State's prevailing political ideology. Their manifestations may differ, but the reality of women's subordination remains constant.CritiqueEconomic FactorsGender IssuesGender RelationsSocial ChangeSocioeconomic FactorsWomen's StatusWorldTJ: UN CHRONICLE</MedlineCitation>

Eleven of the patients underwent laparotomy. Limited-field radiotherapy involving only one side of the diaphragm and extended-field radiotherapy encompassing both sides of the diaphragm were used in 28 and 8 cases, respectively. Median dose to involved areas was 40.0 Gy given daily in 20 2.0-Gy fractions. Salvage treatmentconsisted of MOPP (mechlorethamine, vincristine, prednisone, procarbazine), CVPP/ABDIC (cyclophosphamide, vinblastine, procarbazine and prednisone/doxorubicin, bleomycin, dacarbazine, lomustine, and prednisone), or ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine) chemotherapy and/or involved-field radiotherapy.Median follow-up was 8.8 years (range, 3.0-34.4 years). None of the 15 patients with supradiaphragmatic disease who received limited-field radiotherapy to regions that did not include the mediastinal or hilar nodes subsequently experienced relapse there. Only one of 20 patients who received supradiaphragmatic limited-field radiotherapy alone experienced relapse in the paraaortic nodes or spleen. The 5-year relapse-free and overall survival rates for the 20 patients with stage IA lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin's disease treated with involved-field or regional radiotherapy were 95% and 100%, respectively. There were no cases of severe or life-threatening cardiac toxicity. No solid tumors have been observed in-field in patients treated with limited-field radiotherapy, even though they have been followed up longer than those treated with extended-field radiotherapy (median follow-up, 11.6 vs 5.5 years); two solid tumors have developed in-field in patients who received extended-field radiotherapy.Involved-field or regional radiotherapy alone may be adequate in stage IA lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin's disease patients. Longer follow-up will help to more clearly define the risks of cardiac toxicity and solid tumors that result from involved-field or regional radiotherapy, which appear to be low based on follow-up to date.SchlembachPamela JPJDepartment of Radiation Oncology, The University of Texas M.

Pharmacol.S-15176 inhibits mitochondrial permeability transition via a mechanism independent of its antioxidant properties.93-101Mitochondrial Ca(2+) accumulation can induce a sudden increase in the permeability of the inner membrane. This phenomenon is due to the generation of a large nonselective ion channel, termed the permeability transition pore (PTP), which contributes to cellular injury during ischemia and reperfusion. Inhibition of PTP generation constitutes a relevant pharmacological target to protect a cell from death. In this study, we examined the effect of S-15176 ((N-[(3,5-di-tertiobutyl-4-hydroxy-1-thiophenyl)]-3-propyl-N'-(2,3,4-trimethoxybenzyl)piperazine), a novel anti-ischemic agent, on PTP in rat liver mitochondria. S-15176 prevented PTP opening generated by various triggering agents, as attested by the concentration-dependent inhibition of mitochondrial swelling, of mitochondrial membrane potential dissipation and of NADPH oxidation. These effects were associated with an increase in the Ca(2+) loading capacity of mitochondria. S-15176 was a strong inhibitor of lipid peroxidation, but experiments with another trimetazidine derivative devoid of antioxidant activity indicated that this activity was not essential to the inhibitory effect. Binding studies demonstrated that [3H]S-15176 bound to mitochondrial binding sites, especially those localized in the inner membrane. These sites were shared by several well-known inhibitors of PTP opening. These results demonstrate that the mechanism by which S-15176 protects mitochondria against the deleterious effects of ischemia-reperfusion involves inhibition of PTP opening and provide evidence that the drug operates through low structural specificity binding sites located in the inner mitochondrial membrane.ElimadiAzizAD&#xC3;&#xA9;partement de Pharmacologie, Facult&#xC3;&#xA9; de M&#xC3;&#xA9;decine de Paris XII, Cr&#xC3;&#xA9;teil, FranceJullienVincentVTillementJean PaulJPMorinDidierDengJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tNetherlandsEur J Pharmacol12543540014-29990Antioxidants0Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins0Piperazines0S 151760mitochondrial permeability transition pore53-59-8NADPSY7Q814VUPCalciumIMAnimalsAntioxidantspharmacologyBinding SitesCalciummetabolismLipid Peroxidationdrug effectsMaleMembrane Potential, Mitochondrialdrug effectsMitochondria, Liverdrug effectsmetabolismMitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteinsdrug effectsmetabolismNADPmetabolismOxidation-ReductionPiperazinespharmacologyRatsRats, Wistar</MedlineCitation>

Pharmacol.Risperidone reduces limited access alcohol drinking in alcohol-preferring rats.121-7An atypical antipsychotic drug risperidone reduced ethanol drinking of ethanol-preferring Alko, Alcohol (AA) rats in a limited access paradigm. Its effect was transient at a dose known to preferentially antagonize the 5-HT(2) receptors (0.1 mg/kg, s.c.), but long-lasting when the dose was increased to 1.0 mg/kg that also blocks dopamine D(2) receptors. Risperidone also reduced dose-dependently locomotor activity and limited access saccharin intake of the AA rats, indicating that its effect on ethanol drinking was not selective. Risperidone at 0.1 mg/kg given before four successive daily ethanol-drinking sessions significantly reduced the ethanol intake. These data from an animal model of high ethanol intake suggest that risperidone should be tested in various populations of alcoholics for reducing ethanol consumption.IngmanKimmoKDepartment of Pharmacology and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Turku, Turku, FinlandHonkanenAapoAHyyti&#xC3;&#xA4;PetriPHuttunenMatti OMOKorpiEsa RERengJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tNetherlandsEur J Pharmacol12543540014-29990Antipsychotic Agents0Dopamine D2 Receptor Antagonists0Serotonin 5-HT2 Receptor AntagonistsFST467XS7DSaccharinL6UH7ZF8HCRisperidoneIMAlcohol Drinkingprevention &amp; controlAlcoholismdrug therapyAnimalsAntipsychotic Agentsadministration &amp; dosagepharmacologyDisease Models, AnimalDopamine D2 Receptor AntagonistsDose-Response Relationship, DrugMaleMotor Activitydrug effectsRatsRisperidoneadministration &amp; dosagepharmacologySaccharinSelf AdministrationSerotonin 5-HT2 Receptor Antagonists</MedlineCitation>

Pharmacol.Behavioral effects of rimcazole analogues alone and in combination with cocaine.109-19Several sigma receptor ligands have been reported to also have affinity for the dopamine transporter, among them rimcazole (9-[3-(cis-3,5-dimethyl-1-piperazinyl)propyl]carbazole dihydrochloride). However, rimcazole lacks behavioral effects like those of other dopamine uptake inhibitors, such as cocaine and GBR 12909 (1-(2-[bis(4-fluorophenyl)methoxy]ethyl)-4-(3-phenylpropyl)piperazine dihydrochloride). Because of this profile, the interactions with cocaine of rimcazole and several of its novel analogues were assessed. The compounds studied were rimcazole, its N-methyl analogue, SH 1-73 (9-[3-(cis-3,5-dimethyl-4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-propyl]carbazole hydrobromide), the dibrominated analogue, SH 1-76 (3,6-dibromo-9-[3-(cis-3,5-dimethyl-1-piperazinyl)-propyl]carbazole hydrochloride), and the N-propylphenyl analogues, SH 3-24 ([3-(cis-3,5-dimethyl-4-[3-phenylpropyl]-1-piperazinyl)-propyl]diphenylamine hydrochloride) and SH 3-28 (9-[3-(cis-3,5-dimethyl-4-[3-phenylpropyl]-1-piperazinyl)-propyl]carbazole hydrobromide). The former has a diphenyl-amine group in place of the carbazole moiety of rimcazole, giving the compound additional structural similarity to GBR 12909. The rimcazole analogues produced dose-related decreases in locomotor activity, and also decreased cocaine-stimulated activity in mice. In rats trained to discriminate 10 mg/kg cocaine (i.p.) from saline injections, cocaine and GBR 12909 each produced a dose-related increase in cocaine-appropriate responding. Cocaine also increased rates of responding. SH 3-28 decreased cocaine-appropriate responding at the cocaine training dose to about 58% (SH 3-28) with two of five subjects selecting the cocaine response key. Neither rimcazole nor SH 3-24 produced a significant attenuation of the discriminative effects of cocaine. Rimcazole and its analogs all attenuated the increases in rates of responding produced by cocaine. In contrast to effects obtained with rimcazole analogs, GBR 12909 potentiated the cocaine-induced increases in locomotor activity and operant behavior, as well as the discriminative-stimulus effects of cocaine. The present results indicate that analogues of rimcazole can attenuate the behavioral effects of cocaine, and though the mechanism for these effects is not presently clear, it is possible that this attenuation maybe mediated by actions of the rimcazole analogues at the dopamine transporter and/or sigma receptors.KatzJonathan LJLDepartment of Health and Human Services, Medications Discovery Research Branch, NIDA Intramural Research Program, National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, MD 21224, USA. jkatz@intra.nida.nih.govLibbyTherissa ATAKopajticTheresaTHusbandsStephen MSMNewmanAmy HauckAHengJournal ArticleResearch Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralNetherlandsEur J Pharmacol12543540014-29990Carbazoles0Dopamine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins0Dopamine Uptake Inhibitors0Receptors, sigmaC3N1PS8CX1rimcazoleI5Y540LHVRCocaineIMAnimalsBehavior, Animaldrug effectsCarbazolesadministration &amp; dosageagonistspharmacologyCocaineadministration &amp; dosagepharmacologyConditioning, Operantdrug effectsDopamine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteinsdrug effectsmetabolismDopamine Uptake Inhibitorsadministration &amp; dosagepharmacologyDose-Response Relationship, DrugMaleMiceMotor Activitydrug effectsRatsRats, Sprague-DawleyReceptors, sigmadrug effectsmetabolismStructure-Activity Relationship</MedlineCitation>

Platelet counts were culled from the records on date of presentation and prior to advent of enzyme replacement therapy where relevant.Of 138 Ashkenazi Jewish patients, 31 patients had platelet counts &lt;60,000/mm&lt;PRE&gt;3&lt;/PRE&gt; and 37 patients had normal platelet counts (&gt;150,000/mm&lt;PRE&gt;3&lt;/PRE&gt;). Of the former group, 4/31 (13%) and of the latter group, 3/37 (8%), had the CC genotype. Although all seven patients had relatively mild Gaucher disease (only one required therapy), there was no statistically significant difference in allele frequency of the IL-6 promoter polymorphism in either group relative to healthy Ashkenazi Jews.Whether comparing patients with Gaucher disease with normal platelet counts or with thrombocytopenia to healthy Ashkenazi Jews, there was no difference in frequency of the CC state. Thus, the IL-6 promoter polymorphism may not influence Gaucher disease to induce lower platelet counts as shown in other normal Caucasians.ElsteinDeborahDAltarescuGheonaGZimranAriAengJournal ArticleEnglandHematology97083881024-53320Interleukin-6IMAdolescentAdultAgedAged, 80 and overCase-Control StudiesChildChild, PreschoolFemaleGaucher DiseasebloodgeneticsHumansInterleukin-6bloodgeneticsJewsgeneticsMaleMiddle AgedPlatelet CountPolymorphism, GeneticPromoter Regions, GeneticThrombocytopeniabloodgeneticsYoung Adult</MedlineCitation>

The definition of refractory ascites has already been established, but using the dosage of diuretics that correlates with the definition of refractory ascites in an out-patient department will lower the compliance of the patient, as well as causing serious complications, such as hepatic encephalopathy and hyponatremia, as the dosage of diuretics is increased. Due to this fact, it is very difficult to apply this definition of refractory ascites to patients in a domestic out-patient department. In this study, in situations where there are difficulties in applying the diuretics dosage according to definition of refractory ascites, we tried to find out whether measuring the value of urine sodium after the administration of intravenous furosemide can be the standard in early differentiation of the response to diuretics treatment.We reviewed 16 cases of liver cirrhosis with ascites and classified them into two groups by the response to diuretics. The diuretics-responsive ascites group was 8 cases and the diuretics-unresponsive ascites group consisted of 8 cases. After admission, we examined the patients' CBC, biochemical liver function test, spot urine sodium, and 24 hour creatinine clearance. After the beginning of the experiment, all diuretic therapy was stopped for 3 days. Daily we examined the patients' CBC, biochemical liver function test, and in the 3rd experiment day, we measured 24-hour urine volume and sodium. In the 4th experiment day, after sampling for ADH, plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone level, we administrated the furosemide 80 mg I.V, and measured the amount of 8 hour urine volume and sodium.The plasma aldosterone level was significantly higher in the diuretics- unresponsive ascites group than in the diuretics-responsive ascites group. In the 4th experiment day, the amount of urine volume and sodium was very significantly lower in the diuretics-unresponsive ascites group than in the diuretics-responsive ascites group (1297.5 +/-80.9 vs 2003.7 +/-114.6 ml, p&lt;0.005, 77.3 +/-8.2 vs 211.8 +/-12.6 mEq, p&lt;0.001).In out-patient departments, the measurement of urine sodium 8 hours after administrating 80 mg of intravenous furosemide, will help in differentiating ascites patients with lower treatment response to diuretics.ChoHyun SeokHSResearch Institute of Digestive Disease, Hanyang University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.ParkGeun TaeGTKimYoung HoonYHShimSung GonSGKimJin BaeJBLeeOh YoungOYChoiHo SoonHSHahmJoon SooJSLeeMin HoMHkorEnglish AbstractJournal ArticleKorea (South)Taehan Kan Hakhoe Chi96075341226-04790Diuretics7LXU5N7ZO5Furosemide9NEZ333N27SodiumIMAdultAgedAscitesdrug therapyetiologyurineDiureticsadministration &amp; dosageFemaleFurosemideadministration &amp; dosageHumansInfusions, IntravenousLiver CirrhosiscomplicationsMaleMiddle AgedSodiumurine</MedlineCitation>

Given unaligned sequences of length L, these methods have O(L) time complexity. The ability of compressed amino acid alphabets to extend these techniques to distantly related proteins was investigated. The performance of these algorithms was evaluated for different alphabets and choices of k using a test set of 1848 pairs of structurally alignable sequences selected from the FSSP database. Distance measures derived from k-mer counting were found to correlate well with percentage identity derived from sequence alignments. Compressed alphabets were seen to improve performance in local similarity discovery, but no evidence was found of improvements when applied to distance estimates. The performance of our local similarity discovery method was compared with the fast Fourier transform (FFT) used in MAFFT, which has O(L log L) time complexity. The method for achieving comparable coverage to FFT is revealed here, and is more than an order of magnitude faster. We suggest using k-mer distance for fast, approximate phylogenetic tree construction, and show that a speed improvement of more than three orders of magnitude can be achieved relative to standard distance methods, which require alignments.EdgarRobert CRCbob@drive5.comengJournal Article20040116EnglandNucleic Acids Res04110110305-10480Amino Acids0ProteinsIMMol Biol Evol. 1987 Jul;4(4):406-253447015J Theor Biol. 1986 Mar 21;119(2):205-183461222J Mol Biol. 1990 Oct 5;215(3):403-102231712J Mol Biol. 1991 Jun 5;219(3):555-652051488Comput Appl Biosci. 1992 Jun;8(3):275-821633570Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1992 Nov 15;89(22):10915-91438297Nucleic Acids Res. 1994 Nov 11;22(22):4673-807984417Proc Int Conf Intell Syst Mol Biol. 1996;4:230-408877523Nucleic Acids Res. 1998 Jan 1;26(1):316-99399863Proteins. 2000 Feb 1;38(2):149-6410656262Protein Eng. 2000 Mar;13(3):149-5210775656J Comput Biol. 2000 Feb-Apr;7(1-2):1-4610890386Mol Biol Evol. 2002 Jan;19(1):8-1311752185Nucleic Acids Res. 2002 Jul 15;30(14):3059-6612136088J Mol Biol. 2003 Feb 7;326(1):317-3612547212Bioinformatics. 2003 Mar 1;19(4):513-2312611807Protein Eng. 2003 May;16(5):323-3012826723Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1988 Apr;85(8):2444-83162770AlgorithmsAmino AcidsanalysisComputational BiologymethodsEvolution, MolecularMolecular Sequence DataPhylogenyProteinschemistrySequence AlignmentmethodsSequence Homology, Amino AcidSoftwareTime FactorsPMC373290</MedlineCitation>

We demonstrate here that RNA transcripts from the T7 class II promoter phi2.5 have superior 5' homogeneity over those from the phi6.5 promoter, with comparable total RNA yields. The overall homogeneity of RNA transcripts is improved to different degrees depending on RNA sequences, although transcription under phi2.5 does not affect the 3' heterogeneity of RNA. In combination with 3' RNA trimming by DNAzymes or ribozymes, this ATP- initiated transcription system based on the T7 phi2.5 promoter can provide excellent quality of RNA for applications requiring a high degree of RNA size homogeneity.ColemanTricia MTMDepartment of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Southern Mississippi, Hattiesburg, MS 39406-5043, USA.WangGuocanGHuangFaqingFengJournal ArticleResearch Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.20040115EnglandNucleic Acids Res04110110305-104803' Untranslated Regions05' Untranslated Regions0RNA, Viral8L70Q75FXEAdenosine TriphosphateIMCurr Opin Struct Biol. 2000 Jun;10(3):298-30210851189RNA. 1999 Sep;5(9):1268-7210496227Methods. 2001 Mar;23(3):201-511243833Nucleic Acids Res. 2002 Jun 15;30(12):e5612060694Chem Biol. 2002 Nov;9(11):1227-3612445773Nucleic Acids Res. 2003 Feb 1;31(3):e812560511Nucleic Acids Res. 2003 Aug 1;31(15):e8212888534Chembiochem. 2003 Oct 6;4(10):936-6214523911RNA. 2003 Dec;9(12):1562-7014624011J Mol Biol. 1983 Jun 5;166(4):477-5356864790Nucleic Acids Res. 1987 Nov 11;15(21):8783-983684574J Biol Chem. 1988 Dec 5;263(34):18123-73192528Nature. 1992 Jan 9;355(6356):184-61370345Nucleic Acids Res. 1992 Sep 11;20(17):4515-231383928Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1993 Apr 15;90(8):3680-47682716Nature. 1994 Nov 3;372(6501):68-747969422J Mol Biol. 1995 Jun 2;249(2):398-4087540213Methods Enzymol. 1995;261:300-228569501Methods Enzymol. 1995;261:350-808569503Nucleic Acids Res. 1996 Mar 1;24(5):977-88600468Science. 1996 Sep 20;273(5282):1678-858781224Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1997 Apr 29;94(9):4262-69113977RNA. 1998 Oct;4(10):1313-79769105Science. 1998 Oct 9;282(5387):259-649841391RNA. 1999 May;5(5):618-2110334331Biochemistry. 2000 Dec 19;39(50):15548-55111125413' Untranslated Regionsgeneticsmetabolism5' Untranslated RegionsgeneticsmetabolismAdenosine TriphosphatemetabolismpharmacologyBacteriophage T7geneticsBase SequenceGene Expression Regulation, ViralMolecular Sequence DataMolecular WeightPromoter Regions, GeneticgeneticsRNA, ViralchemistrygeneticsmetabolismTranscription, Geneticdrug effectsPMC373309</MedlineCitation>

This photochemical property was utilized in the development of hydrazones as photo-induced DNA-cleaving agents. Irradiation with 350 nm UV light of arylhydrazones bearing substituents of various types in a phosphate buffer solution containing the supercoiled circular phiX174 RFI DNA at pH 6.0 resulted in single-strand cleavage of DNA.

Prior to stress, the warm contact group underwent a 10-minute period of handholding while viewing a romantic video. Followed by a 20-second hug with their partner, while the no contact group rested quietly for 10 minutes and 20 seconds. In response to a public speaking task, individuals receiving prestress partner contact demonstrated lower systolic BP diastolic BP, and heart rate increases compared with the no contact group. The effects of warm contact were comparable for men and women and were greater for African Americans compared with Caucasians. These findings suggest that affectionate relationships with a supportive partner may contribute to lower reactivity to stressful life events and may partially mediate the benefit of marital support on better cardiovascular health.GrewenKaren MKMDepartment of Psychiatry, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 27599-7175, USA. karen_grewen@med.unc.eduAndersonBobbi JBJGirdlerSusan SSSLightKathleen CKCengHL64927HLNHLBI NIH HHSUnited StatesRR00046RRNCRR NIH HHSUnited StatesJournal ArticleResearch Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.United StatesBehav Med88042640896-4289IMAdultAffectBlood PressurephysiologyBody TemperatureFemaleHeart RatephysiologyHumansLife Change EventsMaleMarriagepsychologyMiddle AgedSpeechSpousesTouch</MedlineCitation>

A 60-year-old man presented to the emergency department (ED) 1 hour after being stung by a 12-cm centipede. He complained of right great toe pain that did not radiate to his leg. The patient had no known ischemic heart disease. He did not describe any exertional symptoms but admitted experiencing weakness. During the ED course, concurrent with obtaining peripheral intravenous access, the patient experienced diaphoresis, dizziness, hypotension, and bradycardia. His ECG showed new ST-T wave changes, which suggested an acute ischemic process. The patient's blood pressure was 89/60 mm Hg, his pulse rate was 47 beats/min, and his respiration rate was 28 breaths/min. In the following hours, ECG findings returned to baseline. His blood pressure improved gradually with fluid resuscitation after approximately 5 hours.

The cats were divided into two groups, sevoflurane group and halothane group, of eight subjects each. As parameters of the hypoxic ventilatory response, A value [the slope of the hyperbolic curve, V(E) = V(0) + A/(Pa(O)(2)-32)] and ratio of V(50) (the minute volume obtained from the hyperbolic equation when Pa(O)(2) = 50 mmHg) to V(0) were studied. These two parameters were examined at three states, sedative state with ketamine as the control, ketamine plus 0.1 MAC inhalation anesthetic, and ketamine plus 0.5 MAC inhalation anesthetic. In the sevoflurane group, the A values were 4789 +/- 1518, 2187 +/- 1214, 1730 +/- 880 (mean +/- SE. ml.min(-1).mmHg) at the control state, 0.1 MAC and 0.5 MAC, respectively. In the halothane group, the A values were 6411 +/- 2368, 2529 +/- 842 and 2372 +/- 545, respectively. The ratios of V(50) to V(0) were 1.32 +/- 0.09, 1.22 +/- 0.09, 1.25 +/- 0.08 in the sevoflurane group, 1.47 +/- 0.18, 1.32 +/- 0.11, 1.54 +/- 0.18 in the halothane group, respectively. The A value at 0.1 MAC of the halothane group was less than the control value significantly. This proved that even low concentration halothane depressed the hypoxic ventilatory responses. The depression of hypoxic ventilatory response could cause postanesthetic hypoventilation. On the other hand, we could not find significant depression on the hypoxic ventilatory response in the sevoflurane group, but we should notice that variances of the hypoxic ventilatory response were large.TamuraCCDepartment of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Japan.DoiMMIkedaKKengJournal ArticleJapanJ Anesth89056670913-8668Q J Exp Physiol Cogn Med Sci. 1958 Apr;43(2):214-2713542754J Clin Invest. 1970 Jun;49(6):1061-725422012Anesthesiology. 1975 Dec;43(6):628-341190538Kokyu To Junkan. 1984 Apr;32(4):349-566379796Anesthesiology. 1974 Oct;41(4):350-604413139Masui. 1986 Nov;35(11):1680-43820557Am Rev Respir Dis. 1980 Dec;122(6):867-717458060Respir Physiol. 1972 Sep;16(1):109-255073532J Appl Physiol. 1975 Dec;39(6):911-51213971Anesthesiology. 1978 Oct;49(4):244-51697078Respir Physiol. 1975 Mar;23(2):181-991144940</MedlineCitation>

U.S.A.Tubular precipitation and redox gradients on a bubbling template.11537-41Tubular structures created by precipitation abound in nature, from chimneys at hydrothermal vents to soda straws in caves. Their formation is controlled by chemical gradients within which precipitation occurs, defining a surface that templates the growing structure. We report a self-organized periodic templating mechanism producing tubular structures electrochemically in iron-ammonium-sulfate solutions; iron oxides precipitate on the surface of bubbles that linger at the tube rim and then detach, leaving behind a ring of material. The acid-base and redox gradients spontaneously generated by diffusion of ammonia from the bubble into solution organize radial compositional layering within the tube wall, a mechanism studied on a larger scale by complex Liesegang patterns of iron oxides formed as ammonia diffuses through a gel containing FeSO(4). When magnetite forms within the wall, a tube may grow curved in an external magnetic field. Connections with free-boundary problems in speleothem formation are emphasized.StoneDavid ADADepartment of Soil, Water, and Environmental Science, Program in Applied Mathematics, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721, USA.GoldsteinRaymond EREengJournal Article20040729United StatesProc Natl Acad Sci U S A75058760027-8424Nature. 2002 May 9;417(6885):13912000951Science. 2004 Mar 12;303(5664):1656-815016997Phys Rev Lett. 1990 Jun 11;64(24):2953-295610041855Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci. 2003 Jan 29;358(1429):59-83; discussion 83-512594918Science. 1988 Dec 23;242(4885):158517788426Science. 1979 Mar 16;203(4385):1073-8317776033Science. 2003 Oct 24;302(5645):580-114576411J Geol Soc London. 1997 May;154(3):377-40211541234J Am Chem Soc. 2003 Apr 9;125(14):4338-4112670257Science. 1965 Feb 5;147(3658):563-7517783259PMC511016</MedlineCitation>

A role of a novel SNF2 factor, PASG.3-5Understanding the biological mechanisms underlying aging and cancer predisposition remains a fundamentally important goal in biomedicine. The generation of a PASG hypomorphic mutant mouse model shows that PASG, an SNF2 family member, is essential for properly maintaining normal DNA methylation and gene expression patterns. Disruption of PASG leads to decreased incorporation of BrdU, accumulation of senescence-associated tumor suppressor genes, and increased senescence-associated beta-galactosidase as well as age-related phenotypes. These observations demonstrate that PASG plays a critical role in maintenance of tissue homeostasis, normal growth and longevity.SunLin-QuanLQDivision of Pediatric Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.ArceciRobert JRJengJournal Article20050103United StatesCell Cycle1011378411551-40059007-49-2DNAEC 2.1.1.-MethyltransferasesEC 3.2.1.23beta-GalactosidaseEC 3.6.4.-DNA HelicasesEC 5.99.-Hells protein, mouseG34N38R2N1BromodeoxyuridineIMAnimalsBromodeoxyuridinemetabolismCell CyclegeneticsphysiologyCell ProliferationCellular SenescencegeneticsDNAmetabolismDNA Helicasesantagonists &amp; inhibitorsgeneticsphysiologyDNA MethylationEpigenesis, GeneticGene Expression Regulation, DevelopmentalHomeostasisgeneticsphysiologyLongevitygeneticsMethyltransferasesphysiologyMiceMice, Mutant StrainsMutationbeta-Galactosidasemetabolism</MedlineCitation>

A novel hypoxia-regulated alternative TrkA splice variant of potential physiological and pathological importance.8-9Nerve growth factor receptor TrkA is critical for development and maturation of central and peripheral nervous systems, regulating proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. In cancer, TrkA frequently exhibits suppressor activity in nonmutated form and oncogenic activity upon mutation. Our identification of a novel hypoxia-regulated alternative TrkAIII splice variant, expressed by neural crest-derived neuroblastic tumors, that exhibits neuroblastoma tumor promoting activity, adds significantly to our understanding of potential TrkA involvement in cancer. Our observation that hypoxia, which characterizes the tumor micro-environment, stimulates alternative TrkAIII splicing, provides a way by which TrkA tumor suppressing signals may convert to tumor promoting signals during progression and is consistent with conservation and pathological subversion by neural crest-derived neuroblastic tumors of a mechanism of potential physiological importance to normal neural stem/neural crest progenitors.TacconelliAntonellaADepartment of Experimental Medicine, University of L'Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy.FarinaAntonietta RARCappabiancaLuciaLGulinoAlbertoAMackayAndrew RARengJournal Article20050105United StatesCell Cycle1011378411551-40050DNA, NeoplasmEC 2.7.10.1Receptor, trkAIMAlternative SplicingCell DifferentiationgeneticsCell HypoxiaCell Line, TumorCell ProliferationDNA, NeoplasmgeneticsGene Expression Regulation, NeoplasticGenetic VariationHumansNeoplastic Stem CellspathologyphysiologyNeural CrestcytologyphysiologyNeuroblastomageneticspathologyphysiopathologyReceptor, trkAgeneticsphysiologySignal Transductiongenetics</MedlineCitation>

Med.The effect of combined estrogen and progesterone hormone replacement therapy on disease activity in systemic lupus erythematosus: a randomized trial.953-62There is concern that exogenous female hormones may worsen disease activity in women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).To evaluate the effect of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on disease activity in postmenopausal women with SLE.Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled noninferiority trial conducted from March 1996 to June 2002.16 university-affiliated rheumatology clinics or practices in 11 U.S. states.351 menopausal patients (mean age, 50 years) with inactive (81.5%) or stable-active (18.5%) SLE.12 months of treatment with active drug (0.625 mg of conjugated estrogen daily, plus 5 mg of medroxyprogesterone for 12 days per month) or placebo. The 12-month follow-up rate was 82% for the HRT group and 87% for the placebo group.The primary end point was occurrence of a severe flare as defined by Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus, National Assessment-Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index composite.Severe flare was rare in both treatment groups: The 12-month severe flare rate was 0.081 for the HRT group and 0.049 for the placebo group, yielding an estimated difference of 0.033 (P = 0.23). The upper limit of the 1-sided 95% CI for the treatment difference was 0.078, within the prespecified margin of 9% for noninferiority. Mild to moderate flares were significantly increased in the HRT group: 1.14 flares/person-year for HRT and 0.86 flare/person-year for placebo (relative risk, 1.34; P = 0.01). The probability of any type of flare by 12 months was 0.64 for the HRT group and 0.51 for the placebo group (P = 0.01). In the HRT group, there were 1 death, 1 stroke, 2 cases of deep venous thrombosis, and 1 case of thrombosis in an arteriovenous graft; in the placebo group, 1 patient developed deep venous thrombosis.Findings are not generalizable to women with high-titer anticardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, or previous thrombosis.Adding a short course of HRT is associated with a small risk for increasing the natural flare rate of lupus. Most of these flares are mild to moderate. The benefits of HRT can be balanced against the risk for flare because HRT did not significantly increase the risk for severe flare compared with placebo.BuyonJill PJPHospital for Joint Diseases, New York University School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA. jill.buyon@nyumc.orgPetriMichelle AMAKimMimi YMYKalunianKenneth CKCGrossmanJenniferJHahnBevra HBHMerrillJoan TJTSammaritanoLisaLLockshinMichaelMAlarc&#xC3;&#xB3;nGraciela SGSManziSusanSBelmontH MichaelHMAskanaseAnca DADSiglerLisaLDooleyMary AnneMAVon FeldtJoanJMcCuneW JosephWJFriedmanAlanAWachsJaneJCroninMaryMHearth-HolmesMicheleneMTanMarkMLicciardiFrederickFengClinicalTrials.govNCT00000419AR 43727ARNIAMS NIH HHSUnited StatesM01 RR00052RRNCRR NIH HHSUnited StatesM01 RR00096RRNCRR NIH HHSUnited StatesU01 AR42540ARNIAMS NIH HHSUnited StatesClinical TrialJournal ArticleMulticenter StudyRandomized Controlled TrialResearch Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralResearch Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.United StatesAnn Intern Med03723510003-48190Estrogens, Conjugated (USP)HSU1C9YRESMedroxyprogesteroneAIMIMAnn Intern Med. 2005 Jun 21;142(12 Pt 1):1014-515968016Ann Intern Med. 2005 Jun 21;142(12 Pt 1):I2215968006AdolescentAgedAged, 80 and overDouble-Blind MethodEstrogen Replacement Therapyadverse effectsEstrogens, Conjugated (USP)therapeutic useFemaleFollow-Up StudiesHumansLupus Erythematosus, SystemicphysiopathologyMedroxyprogesteronetherapeutic useMiddle AgedPostmenopauseRisk Factors</MedlineCitation>

Ther.Effectiveness of an 'half elemental diet' as maintenance therapy for Crohn's disease: A randomized-controlled trial.1333-40Although thiopurines have a proven role in maintenance therapy for Crohn's disease, an alternative therapy is needed for patients intolerant or resistant to thiopurines.To evaluate the effectiveness of home enteral nutrition as a maintenance therapy regimen in which half of the daily calorie requirement is provided by an elemental diet and the remaining half by a free diet. We refer to this home enteral nutrition therapy as 'half elemental diet'.Between 2002 and 2005, 51 patients in remission from two hospitals were randomly assigned to a half elemental diet group (n = 26) or a free diet group (n = 25). The primary outcome measure of this study was the occurrence of relapse over the 2-year period.The relapse rate in the half elemental diet group was significantly lower [34.6% vs. 64.0%; multivariate hazard ratio 0.40 (95% CI: 0.16-0.98)] than that in the free diet group after a mean follow-up of 11.9 months. Compliance was similar in the two groups. No adverse event occurred in any of the patients throughout the study.This randomized-controlled trial shows the effectiveness of an half elemental diet, which is a promising maintenance therapy for Crohn's disease patients.TakagiSSDivision of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan. stakagi@int3.med.tohoku.ac.jpUtsunomiyaKKKuriyamaSSYokoyamaHHTakahashiSSIwabuchiMMTakahashiHHTakahashiSSKinouchiYYHiwatashiNNFunayamaYYSasakiIITsujiIIShimosegawaTTengJournal ArticleRandomized Controlled TrialEnglandAliment Pharmacol Ther87072340269-2813IMAdultCrohn Diseasediet therapyEnteral NutritionmethodsFemaleFollow-Up StudiesFood, FormulatedHumansMaleParenteral NutritionmethodsRecurrenceTreatment Outcome</MedlineCitation>

(Lond.)Declining prevalence of HIV-1 drug resistance in treatment-failing patients: a clinical cohort study.835-9A major barrier to successful viral suppression in HIV type 1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals is the emergence of virus resistant to antiretroviral drugs. We explored the evolution of genotypic drug resistance prevalence in treatment-failing patients from 1999 to 2005 in a clinical cohort.Prevalence of major International AIDS Society-USA HIV-1 drug resistance mutations was measured over calendar years in a population with treatment failure and undergoing resistance testing. Predictors of the presence of resistance mutations were analysed by logistic regression.Significant reductions of the prevalence of resistance to all three drug classes examined were observed. This was accompanied by a reduction in the proportion of treatment-failing patients. Independent predictors of drug resistance were the earlier calendar year, prior use of suboptimal nucleoside analogue therapy, male sex and higher CD4 levels at testing.In a single clinical cohort, we observed a decrease in the prevalence of resistance to all three examined antiretroviral drug classes over time. If this finding is confirmed in multicentre cohorts it may translate into reduced transmission of drug-resistant virus from treated patients.Di GiambenedettoSimonaSInstitute of Clinical Infectious Diseases, Catholic University, Rome, Italy. simona.digiambenedetto@rm.unicatt.itBraccialeLauraLColafigliManuelaMColatigliManuelaMCattaniPaolaPPinnettiCarmenCPannettiCarmenCBacarelliAlessandroAProsperiMattiaMFaddaGiovanniGCaudaRobertoRDe LucaAndreaAengJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tEnglandAntivir Ther98157051359-65350Anti-HIV Agents0RNA, ViralIMAntivir Ther. 2007;12(7):1145Colatigli, Manuela [corrected to Colafigli, Manuela; Cattani, Paola [added]; Pannetti, Carmen [corrected to Pinnetti, Carmen]AdultAnti-HIV Agentstherapeutic useAntiretroviral Therapy, Highly ActiveCD4 Lymphocyte CountCohort StudiesDrug Resistance, ViralgeneticsFemaleGenotypeHIV Infectionsdrug therapyepidemiologyimmunologyvirologyHIV-1geneticsHumansLogistic ModelsMaleMiddle AgedMutationOdds RatioPopulation SurveillancePrevalenceRNA, ViralRisk AssessmentRisk FactorsSex FactorsTime FactorsTreatment Failure</MedlineCitation>

LymphomaAdvanced age and high initial WBC influence the outcome of inv(3) (q21q26)/t(3;3) (q21;q26) positive AML.2145-51AML with inv(3)/t(3;3) are generally considered of having a poor prognosis. For further insight in this rare entity the outcome of 65 inv(3)/t(3;3) positive AML cases were examined with special emphasis o n patient a nd disease related factors at diagnosis. Survival data were available from 35 patients. A hematological CR was achieved in 16/35 patients (46%). Eight patients (50%) relapsed. The median duration of remission was 177 days. Probability of OS was 23% at 2 years. Advanced age and high initial WBC count were associated with shorter OS (p = 0.021 and p = 0.005, respectively). Loss of chromosome 7 was the most frequent additional aberration (n = 34; 52%), followed complex aberrant aberrations (n = 5). Cases with monosomy 7 or the presence of FLT3-length mutations (FLT3-LM)--detected in 13% of cases--were not associated with an even more inferior outcome. Allogeneic stem cell translplantation, performed in 12 cases, resulted in a probability of OS of 62% at 2 years. Our data (1) confirm that inv(3)/t(3;3) AML has a poor prognosis (2) show that age and initial WBC are risk factors for prognosis; (3) suggest that this group may benefit from allogeneic stem cell transplantation.WeisserMartinMMedical Department III, Klinikum Grosshadern, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany. martin.weisser@gmx.deHaferlachClaudiaCHaferlachTorstenTSchnittgerSusanneSengEvaluation StudiesJournal ArticleEnglandLeuk Lymphoma90074221026-802204079A1RDZCytarabine094ZI81Y45Tamoxifen0O54ZQ14I9AminoglutethimideBZ114NVM5PMitoxantroneN29QWW3BUODanazolMAC chemotherapy protocolTAD protocolIMLeuk Lymphoma. 2007 Nov;48(11):2096-717990175AdultAge FactorsAgedAged, 80 and overAminoglutethimidetherapeutic useAntineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocolstherapeutic useChromosome InversionChromosomes, Human, Pair 3Cohort StudiesCytarabinetherapeutic useDanazoltherapeutic useFemaleFollow-Up StudiesHematopoietic Stem Cell TransplantationHumansKaryotypingLeukemia, Myeloid, AcutediagnosisgeneticsmortalitytherapyLeukocyte CountMaleMiddle AgedMitoxantronetherapeutic usePrognosisSurvival AnalysisTamoxifentherapeutic useTranslocation, Genetic</MedlineCitation>

A stationary experimental print head with a row of 320 electrodes (eight electrodes per mm) was employed. The performance of the recording process with regard to the most important parameters, i.e., toner concentration, width of the gap between recording medium and electrodes, recording voltage, and speed will be described. The process exhibits continuous tone characteristics, because the optical density can be varied continuously by the recording voltage. The image resolution which can be achieved is characterized by a modulation transfer function.HinzH DHDLoblHHengJournal ArticleUnited StatesIEEE Trans Med Imaging83107800278-0062</MedlineCitation>

The influence of three kinds of error on the protonation constants has been investigated: error from the strategy of minimization, random error, and error from uncertain estimates of group parameters. An analysis of variance of the log K(i), matrix was made for 7 identical titrations and 8 computational strategies, or of 7 identical titrations and 8 different options of group parameters to be refined. The influence of the standard potential E(0) of the glass-electrode cell on the systematic error in log K is greater than that of the acid concentration (L(0)) or the concentration of titrant used (H(T)). The ill-conditioned group parameters should be refined together with the common parameters (K(i)), otherwise the estimates of log K(i), are not accurate enough. Two ways of calibrating the glass electrode cell were compared. Internal calibration (performed during titration) was more accurate than external calibration done separately. Of the programs tested ESAB and ACBA are the most powerful because they permit refinement of group parameters and internal calibration. Citric acid was chosen as model substance.MelounMMDepartment of Analytical Chemistry, College of Chemical Technology, CS-532 10 Pardubice, Czechoslovakia.BartosMMH&#xC3;&#xB6;gfeldtEEengJournal ArticleNetherlandsTalanta2984816R0039-9140</MedlineCitation>

Although the paper has been written from the perspective of economics, the discipline of the two authors, it is also of relevance to researchers in other disciplines. It is argued that there is a need to ensure that, when considering measurement in this largely neglected area of research, sufficient thought is given to the relationships that are being examined or assessed. We argue further that any attempt at measurement in this area must take into account the historical backdrop and the complex nature of the relationships between these key variables.MooneyGavinGCurtin University of Technology, Perth, Western Australia. g.mooney@curtin.edu.auFohtungNubong GNGengJournal ArticleUnited StatesHIM J1011226431833-3583HAustraliaHealth Services Needs and DemandHumansPovertyPublic HealthSocial ClassSocial Determinants of HealthSocioeconomic Factors</MedlineCitation>

For farmers within the International Federation of Agricultural Producers, it is important that the economic, scientific and practical aspects be taken into account when setting international rules for animal welfare. Farmers also stress the need to combine scientific data with their practical experience. Raising awareness, adopting a risk-based approach, education, labelling, slaughterhouse capacity and animal health, as well as standards and rules, are issues of importance for developing a long distance transportation infrastructure respectful of animal welfare around the world.OsingaKlaas JohanKJInternational Federation of Agricultural Producers/LTO Netherland, Drachten, The Netherlands. klaasjohan@yahoo.comengJournal ArticleItalyVet Ital02015430505-401X</MedlineCitation>

Following extensive migration throughout the embryo, NC cells eventually settle to differentiate into multiple cell types, ranging from neurons and glial cells of the peripheral nervous system to pigment cells, fibroblasts to smooth muscle cells, and odontoblasts to adipocytes. NC cells migrate in large numbers and their migration is regulated by multiple mechanisms, including chemotaxis, contact-inhibition of locomotion and cell sorting. Here, we provide an overview of NC formation, differentiation and migration, highlighting the molecular mechanisms governing NC migration.MayorRobertoRDepartment of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London, Gower Street, London WC1E 6BT, UK. r.mayor@ucl.ac.ukTheveneauEricEengMR/J000655/1Medical Research CouncilUnited KingdomBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research CouncilUnited KingdomMedical Research CouncilUnited KingdomWellcome TrustUnited KingdomJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tReviewEnglandDevelopment87017440950-1991IMAnimalsCell MovementChemotaxisChick EmbryoEmbryonic DevelopmentphysiologyEpithelial-Mesenchymal TransitionGene Expression Regulation, DevelopmentalHumansMiceNeoplasmsmetabolismNeural CrestembryologyphysiologyXenopusZebrafishCancerCell migrationChemotaxisContact-inhibition of locomotionEpithelium-to-mesenchyme transitionNeural crest cellsNeurocristopathies</MedlineCitation>

We present the endovascular treatment of a giant postnephrectomy arteriovenous fistula between the right renal pedicle and the residual renal vein in a 63-year-old man. The purpose of this case report is to demonstrate that the Amplatzer vascular plug (AVP) can be safely positioned to embolize even relatively large arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs). Secondly, we illustrate that this occluder can even be introduced to the fistula via a transvenous catheter in cases where it is initially not possible to advance the deployment-catheter through a tortuous feeder artery. Migration of the vascular plug was ruled out at follow-up 4 months subsequently to the intervention. Thus, the Amplatzer vascular plug and the arteriovenous through-and-through guide wire access with subsequent transvenous deployment should be considered in similar cases.KayserOleODepartment of Radiology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany. o.kayser@rad.uni-kiel.deSch&#xC3;&#xA4;ferPhilippPengCase ReportsJournal Article20130114GermanyGer Med Sci1012276861612-3174IMCardiovasc Intervent Radiol. 2008 Jul;31 Suppl 2:S92-518049835Emerg Radiol. 2008 Mar;15(2):119-2217593408Cardiovasc Intervent Radiol. 2009 May;32(3):543-718574625Int J Urol. 2009 Jul;16(7):648-919659804Heart Vessels. 2010 Jul;25(4):356-820676847Urology. 2011 Oct;78(4):820-621813164J Endovasc Ther. 2011 Dec;18(6):811-822149231Vasc Endovascular Surg. 2003 Jan-Feb;37(1):47-5712577139Curr Vasc Pharmacol. 2003 Oct;1(3):347-5415320481J Chir (Paris). 1978 Oct;115(10):541-4739047Urology. 1985 Jan;25(1):13-63966275Surgery. 1986 Jan;99(1):114-83941996Surgery. 1989 Jan;105(1):1-122643193Ann Vasc Surg. 1992 Jul;6(4):378-801390028J Cardiovasc Surg (Torino). 1998 Aug;39(4):433-69788787Br J Urol. 1962 Mar;34:15-813899592Am J Med. 1964 Oct;37:499-51314215839J Vasc Interv Radiol. 2006 Feb;17(2 Pt 1):363-716517784Vascular. 2009 Jan-Feb;17(1):40-319344582AneurysmdiagnosisetiologytherapyAortographyArteriovenous FistuladiagnosisetiologytherapyEarly DiagnosisEmbolization, TherapeuticinstrumentationmethodsHumansKidneyinjuriesMaleMiddle AgedNephrectomyPostoperative ComplicationsdiagnosisetiologytherapyRenal ArterySeptal Occluder DeviceTomography, X-Ray ComputedUltrasonography, Doppler, DuplexVena Cava, InferiorPMC3546418Obwohl die endovaskul&#xC3;&#xA4;re Katheter-Embolisation von arterioven&#xC3;&#xB6;sen Fisteln minimal-invasiv ist, impliziert die, in der Fistel vorherrschende, hohe Str&#xC3;&#xB6;mungsgeschwindigkeit ein Risiko zur Migration des Embolisats in den nachgeschalteten ven&#xC3;&#xB6;sen Abstrom und in den Lungenkreislauf.

The determination of blood flow changes in individual vessels is an important aspect of understanding these hemodynamic signals. Blood flow can be calculated from the measurements of vessel diameter and blood velocity. When using line-scan imaging, the movement of blood in the vessel leads to streaks in space-time images, where streak angle is a function of the blood velocity. A variety of methods have been proposed to determine blood velocity from such space-time image sequences. Of these, the Radon transform is relatively easy to implement and has fast data processing. However, the precision of the velocity measurements is dependent on the number of Radon transforms performed, which creates a trade-off between the processing speed and measurement precision. In addition, factors like image contrast, imaging depth, image acquisition speed, and movement artifacts especially in large mammals, can potentially lead to data acquisition that results in erroneous velocity measurements. Here we show that pre-processing the data with a Sobel filter and iterative application of Radon transforms address these issues and provide more accurate blood velocity measurements. Improved signal quality of the image as a result of Sobel filtering increases the accuracy and the iterative Radon transform offers both increased precision and an order of magnitude faster implementation of velocity measurements. This algorithm does not use a priori knowledge of angle information and therefore is sensitive to sudden changes in blood flow. It can be applied on any set of space-time images with red blood cell (RBC) streaks, commonly acquired through line-scan imaging or reconstructed from full-frame, time-lapse images of the vasculature.

A positive correlation exists between spine shape and synaptic strength and, consistently, abnormalities in spine number and morphology have been described in a number of neurological disorders. In the present study, we demonstrate that the actin-regulating protein, Eps8, is recruited to the spine head during chemically induced long-term potentiation in culture and that inhibition of its actin-capping activity impairs spine enlargement and plasticity. Accordingly, mice lacking Eps8 display immature spines, which are unable to undergo potentiation, and are impaired in cognitive functions. Additionally, we found that reduction in the levels of Eps8 occurs in brains of patients affected by autism compared to controls. Our data reveal the key role of Eps8 actin-capping activity in spine morphogenesis and plasticity and indicate that reductions in actin-capping proteins may characterize forms of intellectual disabilities associated with spine defects.MennaElisabettaECNR Institute of Neuroscience, Milano, Italy.

Previous work has shown that these data can be leveraged to provide rapid insight during natural disasters, disease outbreaks and ongoing conflicts that can assist in the public health and medical response. Here, we examine and discuss the social media messages posted immediately after and around the Boston Marathon bombings, and find that specific keywords appear frequently prior to official public safety and news media reports. Individuals immediately adjacent to the explosions posted messages within minutes via Twitter which identify the location and specifics of events, demonstrating a role for social media in the early recognition and characterization of emergency events. *Christopher Cassa and Rumi Chunara contributed equally to this work.

(Asteraceae) is a medicinal weed distributed worldwide. Many of its diverse ethnopharmacological uses - namely diarrhoea, inflammation, liver disorders, snake bite and fever - are linked - at least in part - to an uncontrolled release of arachidonic acid metabolites. The crude extract of X. spinosum roots from Jordanian origin dose-dependently inhibited the 5-LOX (IC50 is approximately equal to 10 &#xCE;&#xBC;g/mL), COX-1(IC50 is approximately equal to 50 &#xCE;&#xBC;g/mL), and 12-LOX (IC50 is approximately equal to 170 &#xCE;&#xBC;g/mL) enzymatic pathways in intact pro-inflammatory cells. A direct activity at the level of PLA2 is not probable, but the extract induced the synthesis of the anti-inflammatory eicosanoid 15(S)-HETE, which may in turn inhibit this enzyme. 5-LOX bioguided fractionation of the crude extract led to the isolation of ziniolide, a known 12,8-guaianolide sesquiterpene lactone, from the hydro-alcoholic fraction of the n-hexane extract (IC50=69 &#xCE;&#xBC;M). Both the plant extract and ziniolide are in vitro inhibitors of the phorbol-induced NF&#xCE;&#xBA;B activation, a key regulator of the arachidonic pathway.&#xC2;&#xA9; 2013.BaderAmmarADepartment of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah, 21955, Saudi Arabia.GinerRosa MRMMartiniFrancescaFSchinellaGuillermo RGRR&#xC3;&#xAD;osJos&#xC3;&#xA9; LJLBracaAlessandraAPrietoJos&#xC3;&#xA9; MJMengJournal Article20131001NetherlandsFitoterapia16930290R0367-326X0Anti-Inflammatory Agents0Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors0Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acids0Lipoxygenase Inhibitors0NF-kappa B0Phorbols0Plant Extracts0Sesquiterpenes, Guaiane0ziniolide73945-47-815-hydroxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acidEC 1.13.11.-LipoxygenasesEC 1.14.99.1Cyclooxygenase 1XUZ76S9127phorbolIMAnti-Inflammatory Agentsisolation &amp; purificationpharmacologytherapeutic useCyclooxygenase 1metabolismCyclooxygenase Inhibitorsisolation &amp; purificationpharmacologytherapeutic useDose-Response Relationship, DrugHeLa CellsHumansHydroxyeicosatetraenoic AcidsbiosynthesisInflammationchemically induceddrug therapymetabolismInhibitory Concentration 50Lipoxygenase Inhibitorsisolation &amp; purificationpharmacologytherapeutic useLipoxygenasesmetabolismNF-kappa Bantagonists &amp; inhibitorsPhorbolsPhytotherapyPlant Extractschemistrypharmacologytherapeutic usePlant RootschemistrySesquiterpenes, Guaianeisolation &amp; purificationpharmacologytherapeutic useXanthiumchemistryCyclooxygenaseLipoxygenasesNF-&#xCE;&#xBA;BSesquiterpene lactonesXanthium spinosumZiniolide</MedlineCitation>

Neurosci.A new pathway mediating social effects on the endocrine system: female presence acting via norepinephrine release stimulates gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone in the paraventricular nucleus and suppresses luteinizing hormone in quail.9803-1110.1523/JNEUROSCI.3706-13.2014Rapid effects of social interactions on transient changes in hormonal levels are known in a wide variety of vertebrate taxa, ranging from fish to humans. Although these responses are mediated by the brain, neurochemical pathways that translate social signals into reproductive physiological changes are unclear. In this study, we analyzed how a female presence modifies synthesis and/or release of various neurochemicals, such as monoamines and neuropeptides, in the brain and downstream reproductive hormones in sexually active male Japanese quail. By viewing a female bird, sexually active males rapidly increased norepinephrine (NE) release in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, in which gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH) neuronal cell bodies exist, increased GnIH precursor mRNA expression in the PVN, and decreased luteinizing hormone (LH) concentration in the plasma. GnIH is a hypothalamic neuropeptide that inhibits gonadotropin secretion from the pituitary. It was further shown that GnIH can rapidly suppress LH release after intravenous administration in this study. Centrally administered NE decreased plasma LH concentration in vivo. It was also shown that NE stimulated the release of GnIH from diencephalic tissue blocks in vitro. Fluorescence double-label immunohistochemistry indicated that GnIH neurons received noradrenergic innervations, and immunohistochemistry combined with in situ hybridization have further shown that GnIH neurons expressed &#xCE;&#xB1;2A-adrenergic receptor mRNA. These results indicate that a female presence increases NE release in the PVN and stimulates GnIH release, resulting in the suppression of LH release in sexually active male quail.

They are found throughout the oceans but reach their largest numbers in stratified, oligotrophic gyres, which are an expanding habitat in the warming oceans. SAR11 likely had a Precambrian origin and, over geological time, evolved into the niche of harvesting labile, low-molecular-weight dissolved organic matter (DOM). SAR11 cells are minimal in size and complexity, a phenomenon known as streamlining that is thought to benefit them by lowering the material costs of replication and maximizing transport functions that are essential to competition at ultralow nutrient concentrations. One of the surprises in SAR11 metabolism is their ability to both oxidize and produce a variety of volatile organic compounds that can diffuse into the atmosphere. SAR11 cells divide slowly and lack many forms of regulation commonly used by bacterial cells to adjust to changing environmental conditions. As a result of genome reduction, they require an unusual range of nutrients, which leads to complex biochemical interactions with other plankton. The study of SAR11 is providing insight into the biogeochemistry of labile DOM and is affecting microbiology beyond marine science by providing a model for understanding the evolution and function of streamlined cells.GiovannoniStephen JSJDepartment of Microbiology, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon 97331; email: steve.giovannoni@oregonstate.edu.engJournal Article20160928United StatesAnn Rev Mar Sci1015362461941-0611carbon cycledissolved organic matterproteorhodopsinstreamlining</MedlineCitation>

The axonemes of motile cilia and immotile kinocilia contain 9 peripheral microtubule doublets, a central microtubule pair, and 9 connecting radial spokes. Aberrant radial spoke components RSPH1, 3, 4a and 9 have been linked with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a disorder characterized by ciliary dysmotility; yet, radial spoke functions remain unclear. Here we show that zebrafish Rsph9 is expressed in cells bearing motile cilia and kinocilia, and localizes to both 9&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2030;+&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2030;2 and 9&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2030;+&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2030;0 ciliary axonemes. Using CRISPR mutagenesis, we show that rsph9 is required for motility of presumptive 9&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2030;+&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2030;2 olfactory cilia and, unexpectedly, 9&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2030;+&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2030;0 neural cilia. rsph9 is also required for the structural integrity of 9&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2030;+&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2030;2 and 9&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2030;+&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2030;0 ciliary axonemes. rsph9 mutant larvae exhibit reduced initiation of the acoustic startle response consistent with hearing impairment, suggesting a novel role for Rsph9 in the kinocilia of the inner ear and/or lateral line neuromasts. These data identify novel roles for Rsph9 in 9&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2030;+&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2030;0 motile cilia and in sensory kinocilia, and establish a useful zebrafish PCD model.SedykhIrinaIDepartment of

New Zealand and the United Kingdom have increased the recommended dose of polyclonal human immunoglobulin for post-exposure prophylaxis within the last decade in response to concerns about decreasing levels of measles antibodies in these products. This study used the plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT) to measure the titer of measles-specific antibodies in Australian immunoglobulin products for post-exposure prophylaxis and compared the utility of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to the PRNT in available Australian and international samples: Australian intramuscular (n = 10), Australian intravenous (n = 28), New Zealand intramuscular (n = 2), Hizentra (subcutaneous)(USA) (n = 3), and Privigen (intravenous)(USA) (n = 2). Measles titres in Australian IM and IV immunoglobulins ranged from 51 to 76 IU/mL and 6 to 24&#xC2;&#xA0;IU/mL respectively, as measured by PRNT calibrated to the WHO 3rd international standard. ELISA titres were variable but higher than PRNT titres in all tested samples. Measles antibody titres in Australian immunoglobulin products meet consensus-prescribed international thresholds. Development of a convenient, standardized, readily accessible assay for determination of measles titres in immunoglobulin products would be useful for future studies and facilitate international comparisons.YoungMegan KMKa School of Medicine and Menzies Health Institute Queensland , Griffith University , Gold Coast , Australia.BertoliniJosephJb CSL Behring (Australia) Pty Ltd , Broadmeadows , Australia.KotharuPushpaPb CSL Behring (Australia) Pty Ltd , Broadmeadows , Australia.MaherDarrylDb CSL Behring (Australia) Pty Ltd , Broadmeadows , Australia.CrippsAllan WAWa School of Medicine and Menzies Health Institute Queensland , Griffith University , Gold Coast , Australia.engComparative StudyJournal Article20161020United StatesHum Vaccin Immunother1015726522164-55150Antibodies, Viral0Biological ProductsIMCMAJ. 2014 Apr 15;186(7):E205-624638029Am J Epidemiol. 2000 Jun 1;151(11):1039-48; discussion 1049-5210873127J Clin Immunol. 2010 Jul;30(4):574-8220405177Hum Vaccin Immunother. 2013 Sep;9(9):1885-9323783220MMWR Recomm Rep. 2013 Jun 14;62(RR-04):1-3423760231Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2014 Apr 01;(4):CD01005624687262Wkly Epidemiol Rec. 2012 Feb 3;87(5):45-5222308581J Virol Methods. 2011 Dec;178(1-2):124-821939689Przegl Epidemiol. 2014;68(3):417-20, 527-925394302J Pediatr. 2001 Jun;138(6):926-811391343MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2015 Feb 20;64(6):153-425695321Euro Surveill. 2014 Dec 11;19(49):null25523970Vaccine. 2007 Dec 21;26(1):59-6618063236N Z Med J. 2015 Sep 25;128(1422):53-6226411847Antibodies, ViralimmunologyAustraliaBiological ProductsstandardsEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent AssayHumansImmunization, PassivemethodsMeaslesprevention &amp; controlNeutralization TestsPost-Exposure ProphylaxismethodsViral Plaque AssayAustraliablood productsimmunoglobulinmeaslesprevention</MedlineCitation>

The fatality gradually decreased with improved living standards and further alleviated when many immunization programs were introduced. However, numerous drug-resistant strains emerged recently that consequently decreased the efficacy of current therapeutics and vaccines, thereby obliging the scientific community to start investigating new therapeutic targets in pathogenic microorganisms. In this study, our contributions include the prediction of modelome of 13 C. diphtheriae strains, using the MHOLline workflow. A set of 463 conserved proteins were identified by combining the results of pangenomics based core-genome and core-modelome analyses. Further, using subtractive proteomics and modelomics approaches for target identification, a set of 23 proteins was selected as essential for the bacteria. Considering human as a host, eight of these proteins (glpX, nusB, rpsH, hisE, smpB, bioB, DIP1084, and DIP0983) were considered as essential and non-host homologs, and have been subjected to virtual screening using four different compound libraries (extracted from the ZINC database, plant-derived natural compounds and Di-terpenoid Iso-steviol derivatives). The proposed ligand molecules showed favorable interactions, lowered energy values and high complementarity with the predicted targets. Our proposed approach expedites the selection of C. diphtheriae putative proteins for broad-spectrum development of novel drugs and vaccines, owing to the fact that some of these targets have already been identified and validated in other organisms.JamalSyed BabarSBPG program in Bioinformatics (LGCM), Institute of Biological Sciences, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG,

Dis.Molecular Characterization of Corynebacterium diphtheriae Outbreak Isolates, South Africa, March-June 2015.1308-131510.3201/eid2308.162039In 2015, a cluster of respiratory diphtheria cases was reported from KwaZulu-Natal Province in South Africa. By using whole-genome analysis, we characterized 21 Corynebacterium diphtheriae isolates collected from 20 patients and contacts during the outbreak (1 patient was infected with 2 variants of C.&#xC2;&#xA0;diphtheriae). In addition, we included 1 cutaneous isolate, 2 endocarditis isolates, and 2 archived clinical isolates (ca. 1980) for comparison. Two novel lineages were identified, namely, toxigenic sequence type (ST) ST-378 (n = 17) and nontoxigenic ST-395 (n = 3). One archived isolate and the cutaneous isolate were ST-395, suggesting ongoing circulation of this lineage for &gt;30 years. The absence of preexisting molecular sequence data limits drawing conclusions pertaining to the origin of these strains; however, these findings provide baseline genotypic data for future cases and outbreaks. Neither ST has been reported in any other country; this ST appears to be endemic only in South Africa.du PlessisMignonMWolterNicoleNAllamMushalMde GouveiaLindaLMoosaFahimaFNtshoeGenevieGBlumbergLucilleLCohenCherylCSmithMarshagneMMutevedziPortiaPThomasJunoJHorneValentinoVMoodleyPrashiniPArcharyMoherndranMMahabeerYesholataYMahomedSaajidaSKuhnWarrenWMlisanaKolekaKMcCarthyKerriganKvon GottbergAnneAengJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tUnited StatesEmerg Infect Dis95081551080-6040Infect Immun. 2010 Sep;78(9):3791-80020547743S Afr Med J. 1954 Aug 14;28(33):685-913195862Bioinformatics. 2015 Nov 15;31(22):3691-326198102Epidemiol Infect. 2017 Jul 3;:128669370J Bacteriol. 2012 Jun;194(12):3199-21522505676Genome Announc. 2016 Nov 23;4(6):null27881543Euro Surveill. 2010 Oct 28;15(43):null21087580Euro Surveill. 2008 May 08;13(19):null18761980Emerg Infect Dis. 2013 Nov;19(11):1870-224209492BMC Infect Dis. 2006 Aug 15;6:12916911772J Clin Microbiol. 2010 Nov;48(11):4177-8520844217Bioinformatics. 2014 May 1;30(9):1312-324451623Am J Epidemiol. 1975 Aug;102(2):179-84808123Clin Microbiol Infect. 2016 Dec;22(12 ):1005.e1-1005.e727585941J Infect Dis. 2000 Feb;181 Suppl 1:S27-3410657187Bioinformatics. 2009 Aug 15;25(16):2071-319515959J Bacteriol. 2004 Mar;186(5):1518-3014973027S Afr Med J. 1961 Aug 26;35:711-513870743Nucleic Acids Res. 2007 Jul;35(Web Server issue):W52-717537822J Clin Microbiol. 2012 Jan;50(1):173-522090411J Clin Microbiol. 1978 Dec;8(6):767-8106070J Clin Microbiol. 2005 Jan;43(1):223-815634975Nucleic Acids Res. 2003 Nov 15;31(22):6516-2314602910Infect Genet Evol. 2014 Jan;21:54-724200588Genome Announc. 2017 Mar 2;5(9):null28254972Nat Rev Microbiol. 2011 Jun;9(6):467-7721552286Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis. 2012 Jun;73(2):111-2022494559J Clin Microbiol. 2006 May;44(5):1625-916672385Emerg Infect Dis. 1998 Oct-Dec;4(4):539-509866730J Clin Microbiol. 2002 Dec;40(12):4713-912454177J Clin Microbiol. 2005 Apr;43(4):1662-815814981CRISPRCorynebacterium diphtheriaeMLSTSouth Africabacteriacutaneous diphtheriadiphtheriamolecular epidemiologyoutbreakrespiratory diphtheriarespiratory infectionssequence typewhole-genome sequencing</MedlineCitation>
